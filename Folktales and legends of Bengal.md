# **The Dighi of King Tiyor**

## **English**

Many years ago, in a region adjacent to the Sundarbans called Tala-Kalaroa, there was a village named “Sujan Saha”. The villagers were suffering from a severe lack of water. A kind-hearted man from the village named Sharaf Khan decided to address the issue by digging a large pond. Work began on the pond, but as the project progressed, news reached the king.The king lives in a nearby [village.In](http://village.In) the capital of Manikhar. The king was furious when he heard about the pond being dug.

"A pond is being dug in my kingdom, without informing me? I'll deal with this."

As the king went to halt the pond's construction, a divine message reached his ears: "O foolish king, have you forgotten your past? If you value your life, stop immediately." The king was taken aback, and a forgotten chapter of his past came rushing back to him.

The king then approached Sharaf Khan and said, "I didn't realize my kingdom was facing such trouble. I want to help you with this project." With that, the king donated a significant amount of wealth to the pond's construction. The excavation was completed ahead of schedule. It was a rainy day, and on top of that, it was a huge thirty three-acre pond. The people of the village thought that now the problem of water will be solved. But even in such a deep lake, not a single drop of water is seen. Any water that accumulated disappeared quickly, and the villagers' problems persisted. They soon discovered the cause of this issue.

It is a weekend market in the village. The pond was the main topic of conversation. No one could find a solution. Then, one person said, "Hey\! Tior King has a curse on his forehead\! There is no water in the pond because of him.\!" “What did you say, brother?” they asked, but the man who said it could not be found anywhere. However, everyone became furious with King [Tior.At](http://Tior.At) first, there was laughter, whispering, and murmuring. Then, the suppressed anger against the king emerged. As people talked, more words were exchanged, and the king's hidden history was revealed to everyone.

"What is that history?" someone asked.

"Oh, you don't know? The king isn't a true royal. He was once a sailor's son named Tepa Majhi. Many years ago, he used to ferry people for trade. One stormy day, no one wanted to board his boat except for an old man named Vinod Bamun. Tepa insisted on taking him across the river."

"Why did he insist so much?"

"The sailor's son had evil intentions. Vinod Bamun was a great man and carried a magical stone called Parashmani that could turn anything to gold. Tepa knew this and seized the opportunity. He threw Bamun into the river and stole the Parashmani. With its power, Tepa became the king. But before he died, Vinod Bamun cursed him, saying that one day the people of the kingdom would turn against him. And now it seems that curse is coming true."

Many such conversations took place. The market dispersed, and people returned home, but their anger and resentment towards the king did not lessen. The words reached the king's ears as well. Overwhelmed with worry, he seemed to have stopped eating and drinking. The sins of killing the Brahmin and his deceit weighed heavily on him. Now, people were also denouncing him. Despite being a king, Tior Raja found no peace in his life. The king then thought it was necessary to atone for his sins. The truth was, he was no longer attached to wealth. He had received and enjoyed much in life. What more could he gain in this final stage of life? So, he opened the royal treasury to all the poor and needy. People took whatever they needed. But even this did not bring peace to his mind. The king still couldn't sleep at night, and the pond still had no water.

A few days later, the king received another divine message in a dream: "Do you think giving away your wealth at the end of your life will earn you virtue? Listen, foolish king—if you want to bring water to the pond, someone must sacrifice their life for it. Only then will the problem be solved. Think about it, what will you do?"

The king was now in such a state that he wouldn't regret giving his own life. But asking someone else to do so? Another life? The king was lost in a sea of thoughts. He had committed only sins his whole life. Would anyone else give their life for him? Still, there was no harm in trying. He approached relatives, friends, even the officials of the kingdom, humbling himself and begging for a life. But what greater wealth is there than life itself? No one was willing to give up their life in exchange for wealth.

Then, to atone for his sins and to help the villagers, the king went once more to the kind-hearted Sharaf Khan’s house. The king, for the last time, shared his sorrow with him. After that, the king didn’t need to say anything more. Sharaf Khan, without any demand for money, prepared himself to sacrifice his life in the pond for the king and the people of the kingdom. The king was humbled by Sharaf Khan’s kindness. His long-held royal pride crumbled into dust. Sharaf Khan said, “Return to the palace, King. I will be present at the pond tomorrow morning.”

The news spread quickly. The next morning, Sharaf Khan went to the center of the pond, took a deep breath, and began to dig. As he did, a fountain of water erupted, and Sharaf Khan began to sink. His family rushed to save him, but they too were swallowed by the water. The entire Khan lineage disappeared into the pond of water. It was the curse of Khandal Tior King. Only Sharaf Khan's elderly mother survived, wailing at the pond's edge crying and yelling, ""O cursed pond\! You have swallowed my children and my grandchildren (Puri)\!"\!" Since then, the pond has been known as 'Purikheko Dighi' (The Pond That Ate People).

It is said that after this, the king became a better person and worked for the welfare of his people. The ruins of his palace can still be found in the village of Manikhar, but Sharaf Khan lives on only in the stories. His descendants did not survive, all claimed by the ancient Purikheko Dighi.

বেশ অনেক বছর আগের কথা। সুন্দরবনের পাশের একটি অঞ্চল তালা-কলারোয়া। সেখানকারই একটি গ্রামের নাম ‘সুজন সাহা’। এ গ্রামের সকলেই তখন পানির অভাবে ভুগছে। তাই শরফ খাঁ নামে গ্রামেরই এক ভালো লোক একটি বড় পুকুর কেটে দেবার কথা ভাবলেন। কাজ শুরুও হলো। কিন্তু পুকুর কাটার কাজ যেমনি অনেকটা এগিয়ে গেছে, ওমনি রাজার কাছে খবর গেল। রাজা থাকেন পাশের গাঁয়ে। তার রাজধানী মানিকহারে। দিঘির খবর শুনে রাজা তো মনে মনে রেগে আগুন\!

“আমারই রাজ্যে পুকুর কাটছে, আমাকেই না জানিয়ে\! দাঁড়াও, দেখাচ্ছি মজা।”

রাজা যে-ই পুকুরের কাজ বন্ধ করতে যাবেন, ওমনি কোত্থেকে যেন তার কানে ভেসে এলো এক দৈববাণী– “ওরে গণ্ডমূর্খ রাজা, তুই কি তোর অতীত ভুলে গেছিস? প্রাণের ভয় থাকে তো, এক্ষুনি থাম।” রাজা চুপসে গেলেন। রাজার দাপুটে ভাবও আর থাকলো না। অতীতের ভুলে যাওয়া এক অধ্যায় যেন তার চোখে সামনে পরিষ্কার হয়ে গেলো।

রাজা তখন গিয়ে শরফ খাঁর সাথে দেখা করে বললেন, “আমার রাজ্যের এমন দুর্দিন, আমিই জানি না। আপনার এই কাজে আমি সাহায্য করতে চাই।” এই বলে রাজাও পুকুর কাটার কাজে বহু ধন-সম্পদ দান করলেন। নির্দিষ্ট দিনের আগেই খননের কাজ শেষ হলো। একে তো বর্ষার দিন, তার উপর তিন একর তেত্রিশ শতকের বিশাল একখানা দিঘি। গাঁয়ের লোকে ভাবলো, এবার বুঝি জলের কষ্ট দূর হয়। কিন্তু এত গভীর দিঘিতেও এক ফোঁটা জলের দেখা নেই। বর্ষায় একটু জল জমে, তো পরক্ষণেই উধাও\! গাঁয়ের লোকের সমস্যা দূর হলো না। তবে তারা এই সমস্যার কারণ জানতে পারলো।

গ্রামে সেদিন সপ্তাহান্তের হাটবার। সকলের মধ্যে দিঘি নিয়ে ব্যাপক আলোচনা হচ্ছে। কেউই সুরাহা করতে পারছে না। এরই মধ্যে একজন বলে উঠলো, “আরে তিয়র রাজার কপালে অভিশাপ আছে\! ওর জন্যই তো দিঘিতে জল নেই।” “কী বললে ভাই?” – বলে যেই লোকটিকে খোঁজা হলো, আর তার টিকির নাগালও পাওয়া গেল না। কিন্তু তিয়র রাজার বিরুদ্ধে সবাই তেঁতে উঠলো। প্রথমে হাসি-ঠাট্টা, কানাকানি, গুজগুজ-ফুসফুস। এরপরই রাজার উপর চেপে রাখা রাগ। কথায় কথায় অনেক কথা বাড়ে। রাজার লুকিয়ে-ছাপিয়ে রাখা ইতিহাসটাও সকলের বলাবলিতে বেরিয়ে আসে।

“কী সেই ইতিহাস?”

“আরে জানো না। তিয়র রাজা তো আর রাজার ছেলে নয় গো। এ যে মাঝির ছেলে মাঝি– নাম ছিল তার টেপা মাঝি। অনেক বছর আগে– তার বয়েস যখন একেবারে কম, তখন সে খেয়াপারে নৌকো চালাতো। একদিন খুব ঝড়-বাদলার দিন। কেউ নৌকায় উঠতে চাইছে না। বুড়ো বিনোদ বামুনকে অনেক বুঝিয়ে-শুনিয়ে টেপ্পা তার নৌকোতে তুলে নিলো।”

“কেন, অত জোর করলো কেন\!?

“আহা, মাঝির ছেলের মাথায় কুবুদ্ধির শেষ ছিল না। আশেপাশের সকলেই জানতো, বিনোদ বামুন বড় গুণী লোক। তার থলেতে ছিল এক জাদুর পরশ পাথর। যে পাথর ছোঁয়ালে মাটির ঢেলাও সোনা হয়ে যায়। এ কথা জানা ছিল টেপা মাঝিরও। তাইতো সে সুযোগ বুঝে বামুনকে নদীর জলে ফেলে দিল, আর তার থলে থেকে ছিনিয়ে নিলো সাত রাজার ধন– পরশ পাথর। সেই পরশ পাথরের গুণেই মাঝি আজ রাজা। তবে মরে যাবার আগে বিনোদ বামুন তাকে শাপ দিয়ে গেছিল– একদিন রাজ্যের লোক তার গায়ে থু থু মারবে। কে জানে, সে কথা বোধহয় সত্যি হতে চললো।”

এইমতো শত কথা হয়। হাট ভাঙে। মানুষ বাড়ি ফেরে। কিন্তু রাজার উপর রাগ-ক্ষোভ কারুরই কমে না। কথাখানা রাজার কানেও গেছে। চিন্তায় চিন্তায় তিনি যেন নাওয়া-খাওয়া ছেড়ে দিয়েছেন। বামুনহত্যা, ছলচাতুরির পাপ তো আছেই। এখন লোকজনও ছি ছি করছে। রাজা হয়েও জীবনে শান্তি মিললো না তিয়র রাজার। রাজা এবার ভাবলেন, প্রায়শ্চিত্ত করা দরকার। আসলে কথাটা কী– ধন-সম্পদের মোহ তার আর নেই। অনেক তো পেয়েছেন, অনেক ভোগ করেছেন। এই শেষ বয়সে আর নতুন কীইবা পাবেন\! তাই তিনি রাজকোষ খুলে দিলেন সকল দীন-দুঃখীর জন্য। যার যা দরকার, নিয়ে যেতে থাকলো। কিন্তু এতে যদি মনের শান্তি মিলতো\! রাজার এখনো রাতে ঘুম হয় না। দিঘিতে জলও ওঠে না।

এভাবেই বেশ কিছুদিন কেটে গেল। এক রাতে আবারো স্বপ্নে শোনা গেল সেই অলৌকিক দৈববাণী– “শেষ বয়সে ধন-সম্পদ ছেড়ে দিয়ে তুই বুঝি পুণ্য কামাবি? ভাগ্যদেবতা অত বোকা বুঝি? শোন রে দুষ্ট রাজা– যদি দিঘিতে জল আনতে চাস, তবে তোর জন্য এই দিঘিতে কাউকে প্রাণ দিতে হবে। তবেই সব সমস্যার সমাধান হবে, নইলে নয়। ভেবে দেখ, কী করবি।”

রাজার এখন এমন অবস্থা, নিজের প্রাণ দিতে তার কোন আফসোস হবে না। কিন্তু অন্য কাউকে\! আরো একটি প্রাণ? চিন্তার সাগরে ডুবে গেলেন রাজা। সারা জীবন শুধু পাপই করেছেন। তার জন্য কি আর কেউ জীবন দেবে? তবু চেষ্টা করে দেখতে ক্ষতি নেই। আত্মীয়-স্বজন, বন্ধুবান্ধব, এমনকি রাজ্যের গোমস্তা, কারো দুয়ারই বাকি রইলো না– যেখানে তিয়র রাজা তার মাথা নিচু করে প্রাণভিক্ষা চাইলেন না। কিন্তু প্রাণের চেয়ে বড় সম্পদ আর কীইবা আছে, তাই কেউই ধন-সম্পদের বিনিময়ে জীবন দিতে রাজি হলো না।

তখন রাজার পাপ খন্ডাতে আর গাঁয়ের লোকদের ভালো করতে আরো একবার এগিয়ে গেলেন সেই দয়াশীল শরফ খাঁ। রাজা শেষবার তার বাড়িতে গিয়েই মনের দুঃখ খুলে বলেছিলেন। এরপর রাজার আর কিছু বলতে হয়নি। শরফ খাঁ নিজেই কোনো ধরনের টাকাকড়ি ছাড়া রাজা ও রাজ্যের লোকের জন্য দিঘিতে জীবন দিতে প্রস্তুত হলেন। শরফ খাঁর দয়ায় রাজার মাথা হেঁট হয়ে গেল। এতদিনের রাজগরিমা ধুলায় মিশে গেল। শরফ খাঁ বললেন, “মহলে ফিরে যান রাজা। কাল সকালেই আমি দিঘিতে হাজির থাকব।”

এ খবর পৌঁছে গেল সবার কাছে। পরের দিন সকালবেলা মাথায় গামছা বেঁধে, হাতে মস্ত বড় এক কোদাল নিয়ে শরফ খাঁ দিঘির একেবারে মাঝখানে চলে গেলেন। তারপর আল্লাহর নাম নিয়ে দিঘির তলানিতে কোপ বসিয়ে দিলেন। সঙ্গে সঙ্গেই জলের ফোয়ারা ছিটকে বেরিয়ে এলো। নিমেষে মধ্যে ডুবে যেতে থাকলো শরফ খাঁ। তাকে বাঁচাতে নাকি ছুটে এসেছিল তার ছেলেপুলে, নাতি সকলেই। তাদেরকেও বাঁচানো যায়নি। এক দিঘি জলের মধ্যে খাঁ বংশের সবাই উধাও হয়ে গেল। খণ্ডাল তিয়র রাজার অভিশাপ। বেঁচে ছিল শুধু শরফ খাঁর বুড়ি মা– যে সবাইকে পানিতে তলিয়ে যেতে দেখে দিঘির ধারে চিৎকার করে বলছিল, “ওরে সর্বনাশা দিঘি\! তুই আমার ছাওয়ালডারে খাইলি, আমার পুরিটাও খাইলি\!” সেই থেকে এই দিঘির নাম হয়েছে ‘পুরিখেকো দিঘি’।

শোনা যায়, এর পর থেকে তিয়র রাজা বড় ভালো লোক হয়ে গেছিলেন। প্রজাদের কল্যাণে কাজ করতেন। আজো মানিকহার গ্রামে খুঁজে দেখলে পাওয়া যাবে সেই রাজার রাজপ্রাসাদের ধ্বংসাবশেষ। তবে শরফ খাঁ শুধু বেঁচে আছেন গল্পেই। তার বংশের কেউ বেঁচে নেই– সবই গিলে খেয়েছে ওই পুরিখেকো দিঘি।

# **The tale of Komola Shundori**

# **Plot Summary**

## **English**

In the late 8th century, the vast [Gauda Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Gauda) was beginning to fracture, giving rise to numerous smaller kingdoms. During this time, the ruler of [Pundranagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundranagar) was King Jayanta. A beloved and just ruler, adored by his subjects.

Meanwhile, [King Vinayaditya Jayapira](https://www.jatland.com/home/Jayapida) of Kashmir, having conquered several territories, set his sights on Gauda. His next target was Pundranagar. However, before launching an attack, he wanted to thoroughly assess the battlefield. Disguised and under the cover of night, he wandered through the city, unnoticed by anyone. As he moved through the streets, he carefully observed and assessed the state of the kingdom, preparing for the battle ahead.

As Jayapira wandered through the city, he eventually found himself in the courtyard of the Skandhamandir. There, a dance was taking place, captivating everyone around. And why wouldn’t they be mesmerized? It was the performance of Kamala Shundori, the most renowned dancer in the kingdom.

“Come, see for yourselves...

Kamala dances, pausing with grace\!”

Jayapira joined the crowd, watching intently. The sound of anklets resonated with the rhythm of the dance, echoing in the air. At one point, the anklets stopped. Kamala, the dancer, prepared a betel leaf and offered it to Jayapira. The regal manner of a king in which he accepted it, even in disguise, betrayed his true identity. Jayapira took the betel leaf from her hand with the grace of a king. In that instant, Kamala realized who he truly was. Yet, she said nothing. The first sight of Jayapira had captivated her so deeply that she couldn’t bring herself to put him in danger.

That very night, they met in secret. Kamala's love for her kingdom was boundless, yet Jayapira was the enemy of that very land. But how can the heart be restrained? Their love blossomed like a full moon illuminating the sky of Pundranagar. Kamala, the dancer, found herself caught in a painful dilemma, torn between her love for her country and her love for Jayapira. It was a situation where loss and sorrow awaited on both sides. What could she do? She was at a loss. All she could do was gaze into Jayapira's eyes and hear the ancient melody of anklets echoing in her heart.

What a twist of fate\! Just as Jayapira entered the kingdom, it was besieged by a ferocious lion. The beast terrorized everyone, young and old alike, with daily casualties. The fear of the lion had paralyzed the kingdom; no one dared to move freely for fear of being taken by the beast. With no solution in sight, King Jayanta made a proclamation: whoever could slay the lion would be granted the hand of the princess in marriage.

Jayapira hasn't yet heard of this news. To save both the kingdom and Jayapira himself, Kamala devised a plan. She approached Jayapira and said, “There is no one in this kingdom who can defeat the lion except you. You are a noble king—please save my country from the beast\!” Unable to ignore Kamala’s plea, Jayapira agreed to help. His intention was to deal with the lion swiftly and then return home as soon as possible.

Jayapira quickly subdued the lion, but he was astonished when Kamala threw a ring with his name engraved on it at the lion’s face. With a wry smile, Jayapira remarked, “So this is how you plan to reveal the enemy?” Kamala didn’t respond; she simply cried and wept. Seeing her distress, Jayapira’s heart softened. That night, he chose not to return to his own kingdom.

By morning, the kingdom was in uproar. The news spread far and wide— the lion had been slain\! The brave hero who had defeated the beast was none other than ‘King Jayapira of Kashmir.’ The king, overjoyed, summoned Jayapira and honored him with his daughter’s hand in marriage. The night in Pundranagar turned into a grand celebration, filled with music and revelry.

In the courtyard of the Skandhamandir, not a single lamp was lit. The dancer’s anklets were silent, and she lay in a disheveled state. Both the kingdom and love were saved, but Kamala Shundori’s heart was broken. Although Jayapira later came to visit her, it is said that on that day, in the Skandhamandir, Kamala placed a garland around Jayapira’s neck.

Two miles south of [Mahasthangarh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahasthangarh), on the west bank of the Karatoya River, lies the Skandhamandir. Though now in ruins, with no remnants of its original bricks, stones, or carvings, the site is still known by names like ‘Skandher Dhap’ or ‘Kartik’s Dhap’. The significance of this place is mentioned in texts such as ‘[Karatoya Mahatmya](https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/corpustei/transformations/html/sa_karatoyAmAhAtmya.htm)’ and ‘[Rajatarangini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajatarangini)’. Historically, the temple was a venue for dance and music performances, and many historians believe that some of Bengal’s earliest plays were staged here.

৮ম শতাব্দীর শেষ দিকের কথা। বিশাল গৌড় সাম্রাজ্যে ভাঙন ধরে তখন চারিদিকে ছোট রাজ্যের উত্থান ঘটেছে। এসময় পুন্ড্রনগরের হর্তাকর্তা ছিলেন রাজা জয়ন্ত। প্রজাদরদী রাজাকে প্রজারাও খুব ভালোবাসতো।

ওদিকে একের পর এক রাজ্য জয় করে এবার গৌড়ের দিকে এগিয়ে আসছেন কাশ্মীররাজ বিনয়াদিত্য জয়াপীর। তিনি পুন্ড্রনগরে ঢুকলেন রাজ্য দখল করে নিতে। কিন্তু আক্রমণের আগে একটু যুদ্ধের ক্ষেত্রটা ভালো করে বুঝে নিতে চান। তাইতো রাতের অন্ধকারে তিনি ঘুরে বেড়াচ্ছেন ছদ্মবেশে। কেউই তাকে চিনতে পারছে না। তিনিও রাজ্যের হালচাল বুঝে যাচ্ছেন।

এভাবেই ঘুরতে ঘুরতে জয়াপীর এসে দাঁড়ালেন স্কন্ধমন্দিরের আঙিনায়। সেখানে নাচ হচ্ছে, আশেপাশের সবাই মুগ্ধ দৃষ্টিতে সেই নাচ দেখছে। দেখবে নাইবা কেন? এ যে রাজ্যের সবচাইতে নামিদামি নর্তকী কমলা সুন্দরীর নাচ।

“তোমরা দেখো গো আসিয়া… কমলায় নৃত্য করে থমকিয়া থমকিয়া\!”

জয়াপীরও যোগ দিলেন তাদের সাথে। নাচের মুদ্রার সাথে ঘুঙুর বাজছে, বেজেই চলেছে। এমন এক সময় ঘুঙুর থামলো। নর্তকী এক খিলি পান সাজিয়ে তা তুলে দিলেন জয়াপীরের হাতে। রাজার স্বভাব, ছদ্মবেশেও তা চাপা পড়লো না। রাজার মতোই তার হাত থেকে পান নিলেন জয়াপীর। ব্যস\! কমলা বুঝে গেল তার আসল বেশ। যদিও কাউকে বললো না সে। এক দেখাতেই জয়াপীরকে এত ভালো লেগেছে, তাকে বিপদে ফেলতে চায় না কমলা।

সেই রাতেই চুপি চুপি দেখা করলো তারা দুজনে। কমলার তার রাজ্যের প্রতি ভালোবাসার কোনো হিসেব নেই, এদিকে জয়াপীর সেই রাজ্যেরই শত্রু। তবু মন কি আর বারণ মানে? দুজনের মধ্যে ভালোবাসা যেন পুন্ড্রনগরের আকাশে সেদিন পূর্ণিমার চাঁদ হয়ে আলো ছড়ালো। আর নর্তকী কমলা ফেঁসে গেল দেশপ্রেম ও ব্যক্তিপ্রেমের মাঝখানের এক শাঁখের করাতে। দুদিকেই লোকসান, দুদিকেই হারানোর বেদনা। কী করবে সে? কিছুই জানে না। শুধু জয়াপীরের চোখের দিকে তাকিয়ে সে শোনে এক আদিম ঘুঙুরের বাজনা।

ভাগ্যের কী লিখন, জয়াপীর যখন এ রাজ্যে ঢুকেছেন, ঠিক সেই সময়টাতেই রাজ্য জুড়ে এক বলশালী সিংহের দাপট। ছেলেবুড়ো সকলেই প্রতিদিন প্রাণ হারাচ্ছে। সিংহের ভয়ে রাজ্য জুড়ে কেউ ভালোমতো চলতে ফিরতে পারে না– পাছে পশুরাজ খাজনা মনে করে প্রাণখানা নিয়ে চম্পট মারে\! এ বিপদের কোনো সমাধান না পেয়ে রাজা জয়ন্ত ঘোষণা করে দিলেন, যে এই সিংহকে বধ করতে পারবে– তার সাথেই দেবেন রাজকন্যার বিয়ে।

জয়াপীরের কানে এই খবর এখনো যায়নি। দেশ ও জয়াপীর, উভয়কে বাঁচাতে কমলা এক ফন্দি আঁটলো। জয়াপীরকে গিয়ে সে বললো, “এই সিংহকে মারতে পারে এমন লোক এ রাজ্যে আপনি ছাড়া আর কেউ নেই। আপনি সদয় রাজা, সিংহের হাত থেকে আমার দেশকে রক্ষা করুন\!” কমলার কথা তো ফেলতে পারে না, তাই জয়াপীর এগিয়ে গেলেন। তার ইচ্ছে, সিংহ বধের পরই সাততাড়াতাড়ি বাড়ি ফিরে যাবেন।

সিংহকে কাবু করতে তার বেশি সময় লাগলো না। কিন্তু তিনি অবাক হয়ে দেখলেন, কমলা তার নাম লেখা আংটিখানা সিংহের মুখে ছুঁড়ে মারলো। তখন বাঁকা হাসি হেসে জয়াপীর বললেন, “এই বুঝি দেশের শত্রুকে ধরিয়ে দেবার বুদ্ধি?” কমলা তার জবাবে কিছুই বললো না, শুধু কেঁদে বুক ভাসালো। এই দেখে জয়াপীরেরও মায়া হলো। সে রাতে তিনি আর নিজের রাজ্যে ফিরে গেলেন না।

সকাল হতেই ধুন্ধুমার অবস্থা। রাজ্যজুড়ে শোরগোল, সিংহ মারা পড়েছে\! সিংহ বধ করেছে যে সাহসী বীর, তার খোঁজও মিলেছে। সে আর কেউ নয়, ‘কাশ্মীররাজ জয়াপীর\!’ এবার আর কী– রাজা খুঁজে আনলেন আরেক রাজাকে। মনের খুশিতে মেয়ে কল্যাণ দেবীর হাত তুলে দিলেন জয়াপীরের হাতে। বিয়ের বাদ্যি-বাজনায় রোশনাই হলো পুন্ড্রনগরের রাত। ওদিকে স্কন্ধমন্দিরের আঙিনায় একটিও বাতি জ্বলেনি। নর্তকীর পায়ে আজ ঘুঙুর নেই। এলো কেশে সে লুটিয়ে রয়েছে। দেশ ও প্রেম– দুটোই বাঁচলো। শুধু মন ভাঙলো কমলা সুন্দরীর। যদিও পরে একবার জয়াপীর এসেছিলেন তার সাথে দেখা করতে। শোনা যায়, এই স্কন্ধমন্দিরেই কমলা সেদিন মালা পরিয়ে দিয়েছিলেন জয়াপীরের গলায়।

মহাস্থান থেকে দুই মাইল দক্ষিণে এগিয়ে গেলে করতোয়া নদীর পশ্চিম তীরে পাওয়া যাবে স্কন্ধমন্দির। যদিও মন্দিরের ইট-পাথর, নকশা কিছুই নেই। এখন আছে শুধু ধ্বংসাবশেষ। অনেকে একে ‘[স্কন্ধের ধাপ](https://bn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0_%E0%A6%A7%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AA)’ বা ‘কার্তিকের ধাপ’ নামেও চেনে। ‘করতোয়া মাহাত্ম্য’ ও ‘রাজতরঙ্গিনী’ – এই দুই বইতে এ স্থানের কথা পাওয়া যায়। এই মন্দিরটিতে প্রায় সন্ধ্যাতেই নাচগানের আসর বসতো। অনেক ঐতিহাসিকের মতে, বাংলার প্রথম নাটকগুলোও এখানেই মঞ্চায়িত হতো।

# **Jiyat Kunda \- The well of life**

# **English**

In the year 1636, Shah Ali Asghar, the ruler of the Balkh region in Afghanistan, wished to pass on all the responsibilities of the kingdom to his son. However, his son had no interest in the throne. Instead, he aspired to become a missionary.

The kingdom-averse prince was named Shah Sultan Balkhi. He was a disciple of the pious Sheikh Toufic from Damascus. Following the Sheikh’s orders, he left the throne and dedicated himself to missionary work. One day, the Sheikh instructed him, “Now go to Bengal and focus on spreading the faith.”

Balkhi arrived in Sandwip by a peculiar fish-shaped boat, marking the beginning of his campaign in the region. Because of his arrival in such an unusual vessel, he was commonly known as Mahiswar (the Fish Rider). When he came to Bengal, he was not dressed as a king or sultan but in the simple garb of a fakir. Despite being a missionary, his royal blood did not go unnoticed. Whenever Hindu rulers resisted his mission, he would declare war and ultimately conquer their territories.

One such ruler was King Parashuram of Mahasthangarh. Initially, he did not prevent Mahiswar from staying in the region. He even granted him freedom to move within his own capital, Pundravardhan. However, King Parashuram was strongly opposed to Mahiswar’s missionary efforts.

Trouble began when one of Parashuram's council members converted to Islam. This event led to a fierce conflict between Mahiswar and King Parashuram. The dispute escalated into a significant and intense battle.

Despite killing countless soldiers with his sword, Mahiswar was unable to secure victory. This troubled Shah Sultan Balkhi greatly. Upon investigation, it was discovered that next to King Parashuram’s palace was a remarkable well. This well had the extraordinary power to revive the dead; soldiers who fell in battle were restored to life after touching the well's water. It was reminiscent of the magical rejuvenation stick from fairy tales.

Mahiswar had his own supernatural powers, so he sent a messenger with a piece of cow meat. When the meat was thrown into the well, it contaminated the water, causing it to lose its miraculous ability to revive the dead. The immortal well lost its magic of immortality. Consequently, the fallen soldiers could no longer be revived. King Parashuram was defeated, and Hindu rule in Mahasthangarh came to an end.

The legend says that King Parashuram was famously known as ‘Narasimha Parashuram’. Both parts of this name, ‘Narasimha’ and ‘Parashuram,’ are indeed avatars of Vishnu. This naturally raises the question: Could the Parashuram of the Mahabharata and Ramayana be the same as King Parashuram?

According to a story, the Earth once took the form of a cow and went to Vishnu to express its suffering and distress. Vishnu assured the Earth that he would take the form of Parashuram to alleviate its troubles and hardships. It is possible that, as a fulfillment of this vow, Parashuram made the Earth free of Kshatriyas twenty-one times. Since the Kshatriyas, through their wars, often caused widespread unrest, conflict, and violence, Parashuram viewed himself as the Earth's protector each time he eliminated an unjust Kshatriya.

As a result of his penance, Parashuram obtained an axe, with which he vowed to eliminate all heretical Kshatriyas. He targeted those Kshatriyas who abused their power, deviated from the path of righteousness, or angered him in some way. His axe became a symbol of his resolve to punish and remove those who misuse their authority and acted against the principles of dharma.

Indeed, the legend of Parashuram has not been forgotten, nor has the remarkable power of his rejuvenation well. His legend is intertwined with the history and heritage of Mahasthangarh. According to whispers of legend, during the twelfth century, Parashuram ruled over Mahasthangarh in Bengal. The ruins of his palace can still be found nearby, and right beside the palace lies the famous Jiyon Kund or Jiyon Kupa, the well whose water was said to bring the dead back to life.

After defeating Parashuram in battle, Mahiswar captured the fortress of Pundranagar. Parashuram’s daughter was Shila Devi, a woman renowned for her exceptional beauty and virtues, highly praised by all around. Mahiswar intended to take her along with other captives. Shila Devi, however, preferred death over the loss of her honor at the hands of the invaders. Thus, she chose a dignified death over a life of dishonor.

When the sounds of battle ceased and the captives were to be taken away, Shila Devi made a final prayer to the Creator and slowly descended into the waters of the Karatoya River. There, she submerged herself, choosing self-sacrifice over dishonor. The spot where Shila Devi gave her life is still known today as Shila Devi's Ghat. In some accounts, Shila Devi is also referred to as Parashuram’s sister rather than his daughter.

The sacred Shila Devi's Ghat is revered by many Hindus as a place of great spiritual merit. Every year, on the 10th day of the Shukla Paksha (waxing phase) of the month of Jyestha, a holy bath is performed at the ghat. Devotees come to the waters of the Karatoya River to cleanse themselves of sins and seek purification. In addition, every twelve years, a special sacred bathing ritual known as Poush Narayani Yoga is held at the ghat. It is believed that taking a bath at the Karatoya Ghat and observing a three-night fast can bestow merit equivalent to performing the ancient Ashwamedha Yagna.

If there is uncertainty about the historical existence of Parashuram, then the existence of Shila Devi is also subject to doubt. According to an alternative origin story, the ghat may have been used in ancient times for unloading and storing numerous stones brought by river transport. Over time, the name evolved to "Shila," meaning "stone" or "rocky place," which could have eventually transformed into the name Shila Devi and Shila Devi’s Ghat.

The area around Shila Devi's Ghat, and throughout Mahasthangarh, is rich with legends and a blend of historical and mythical elements, leaving behind numerous archaeological traces. One such site connected to Bengali folklore is ‘Lakshindar’s Mela,’ associated with the famous characters Behula and Lakshindar. On the west bank of the Karatoya River, there is also the Skandhamandir, or Skandher Dhap, tied to other legendary narratives.

## **বাংলা**

সময়টা তখন ১৬৩৬ সাল। আফগানিস্তানের বলখ অঞ্চলের শাসক শাহ আলি আসগর নিজের ছেলেকে রাজ্যের সকল দায়িত্ব তুলে দিতে চাইলেন। কিন্তু ছেলের তো সিংহাসনে মন নেই। তিনি চান ধর্ম প্রচারক হতে।

রাজ্যবিমুখ এই যুবরাজের নাম ছিল শাহ সুলতান বলখী। দামাস্কাস নগরের পীর শেখ তৌফিকের শিষ্য ছিলেন তিনি। পীরের আদেশেই তিনি সিংহাসন ছেড়ে দিয়ে ধর্ম প্রচারের কাজে যোগ দেন। একদিন পীর তাকে বললেন, “এবার তুমি বাংলায় গিয়ে ধর্ম প্রচারে মন দাও।” বলখি তখন এক মাছ আকৃতির নৌকায় করে পৌঁছে গেলেন সন্দ্বীপে, সেই থেকেই এ অঞ্চলে বলখির অভিযান শুরু। মাছের আকৃতির অদ্ভুত নৌকায় করে এসেছিলেন, তাই তাকে মাহীসওয়ার (মৎস্য আরোহী) নামেই বেশি ডাকা হয়। বাংলায় আসার সময় তার পরনে কোনো রাজা বা সুলতানের পোশাক ছিল না, ছিল এক ফকিরের আলখেল্লা। কিন্তু ধর্ম প্রচারক হলেও তার রক্তে বইছে রাজরক্ত, তাইতো যে হিন্দু রাজারা তার প্রচার মেনে নিতো না, তিনি যুদ্ধ ঘোষণা করতেন। এবং শেষমেশ তাদের রাজ্য দখল করে নিতেন।

এমনই একজন ছিলেন মহাস্থানের রাজা পরশুরাম। প্রথমে অবশ্য তিনি মাহীসওয়ারকে এ অঞ্চলে থাকতে বাধা দেননি। নিজের রাজধানী পুন্ড্রবর্ধনেও তার চলাফেরার স্বাধীনতা দিয়েছিলেন। কিন্তু মাহীসওয়ারের ধর্ম প্রচার নিয়ে তার ঘোর আপত্তি ছিল। ঝামেলা বাঁধে, যখন পরশুরামের এক সভাসদ ইসলাম ধর্ম গ্রহণ করে ফেলেন। এরপর যা হওয়ার, তা-ই হলো। মাহীসওয়ারের সাথে বেঁধে গেল রাজা পরশুরামের এক তুমুল যুদ্ধ। তলোয়ারের আঘাতে পরশুরামের অগণিত সৈন্যকে হত্যা করার পরও কোনোভাবেই জিততে পারছিলেন না মাহীসওয়ার। কিন্তু কেন? চিন্তায় পড়ে গেলেন বলখের শাহ সুলতান। খবর নিয়ে জানা গেল, পরশুরামের প্রাসাদের পাশে আছে আশ্চর্য এক কুয়া। সে কুয়ায় স্নান করে মৃত মানুষও ফের জীবিত হয়ে ওঠে। পরশুরামের দলের যে সৈন্যই মারা যাচ্ছিল, সেই জীয়ন কূপের ছোঁয়া পেয়ে আবার যুদ্ধে ফিরে যাচ্ছিল। এ যেন রূপকথার সেই জীয়ন কাঠিরই নামান্তর।

অলৌকিক শক্তি ছিল মাহীসওয়ারেরও, তাইতো তিনি এক চিলকে দূত করে পাঠালেন মুখে এক টুকরো গো-মাংস দিয়ে। সেই গো-মাংস কূপের জলে ফেলতেই জল অপবিত্র হয়ে গেল, হারিয়ে গেল তার মরা মানুষকে জিইয়ে তোলার ক্ষমতাও। অমর কূপ হারালো তার অমরত্বের জাদু। মৃত সৈন্যদের আর বাঁচিয়ে তোলা গেল না। হেরে গেলেন রাজা পরশুরাম। শেষ হলো মহাস্থানে হিন্দুদের রাজত্ব।

কিংবদন্তি বলে, রাজা পরশুরাম ‘নরসিংহ পরশুরাম’ নামে বিখ্যাত ছিলেন। এই নামের দুটি অংশ, অর্থাৎ ‘নরসিংহ’ ও ‘পরশুরাম’ উভয়েই কিন্তু বিষ্ণুর অবতার। এ থেকে মনে প্রশ্ন জাগা স্বাভাবিক, তবে কি মহাভারত-রামায়ণের পরশুরাম আর রাজা পরশুরাম একই? আদৌ কি রাজা পরশুরাম ছিলেন?

একটি গল্প অনুযায়ী, খোদ পৃথিবী একবার একটি গাভীর রূপ ধারণ করে এবং বিষ্ণুর কাছে নিজের দুঃখ-দুর্দশার কথা জানায়। তখন বিষ্ণু পৃথিবীকে আশ্বাস দেন, তিনি পরশুরাম হয়ে জন্মগ্রহণ করে এই দুঃখ-দুর্দশা দূর করবেন। হতে পারে, এই প্রতিজ্ঞারই ফল হিসেবে পরশুরাম পৃথিবীকে একুশবার ক্ষত্রিয়শূন্য করেন। যেহেতু ক্ষত্রিয়দের যুদ্ধের ফলেই পৃথিবীময় বহু অশান্তি, হানাহানি, হত্যা ঘটতো, তাই প্রতিবার কোনো অন্যায়কারী ক্ষত্রিয়কে হত্যার সময় পরশুরাম নিজেকে পৃথিবীর রক্ষাকর্তা হিসেবে দেখতেন।

তপস্যার ফলে তিনি একটি কুঠার লাভ করেন, যার আঘাতে একে একে সব ধর্মবিরোধী ক্ষত্রিয়কে হত্যার প্রতিজ্ঞা করেন পরশুরাম। যে ক্ষত্রিয়রা নিজেদের ক্ষমতার অপব্যবহার করতো, ধর্মের পথে চলতো না এবং কোনো না কোনোভাবে পরশুরামকে রাগিয়ে দিত– তাদের উপরই নেমে আসতো পরশুরামের কঠোর কুঠার।

তবে কিংবদন্তি পরশুরামকে ভোলেনি, ভোলেনি তার জীয়ন কূপের আশ্চর্য জাদুশক্তির কথাও। তার কিংবদন্তি জড়িয়ে আছে মহাস্থানগড়ের ইতিহাস, ঐতিহ্যের সাথে। কিংবদন্তির ফিসফিসানিতে শোনা যায়, দ্বাদশ শতকের দিকে বাংলার মহাস্থানগড়ে রাজত্ব করতেন তিনি, এখনো খুঁজলে মিলে যায় তার প্রাসাদের ধ্বংসাবশেষ। আর সেই প্রাসাদের ঠিক পাশেই রয়েছে সেই জীয়নকুণ্ড বা জীয়নকূপ, যে কুয়োর জল মৃত মানুষকে প্রাণ ফিরিয়ে দিত।

পরশুরামের সাথে যুদ্ধে জিতে যাওয়ার পর মাহীসওয়ার পুন্ড্রনগর দুর্গ দখল করে নেন। পরশুরামের মেয়ে ছিলেন শীলা দেবী। রূপে-গুণে অনন্য এই নারীর প্রশংসায় আশেপাশের সকলেই মুখর ছিল। এমন বিদুষী নারীকেও অন্য বন্দিদের সঙ্গে তুলে নিয়ে যেতে চান মাহীসওয়ার। শীলাদেবীর তখন মনে হয়, যবনের হাতে পড়ে সম্মান হারানোর চাইতে প্রাণ দেয়াও ভালো। তাই তিনি অসম্মানের জীবন থেকে বরং বেছে নেন সম্মানের মৃত্যু।

যুদ্ধের বাজনা যখন থেমে গেল, বন্দীদের নিয়ে যাওয়া হবে, তখন স্রষ্টার কাছে শেষ প্রার্থনা করে শীলা দেবী ধীরে ধীরে নেমে যান করতোয়ার জলে। সেখানেই ডুব দিয়ে আত্মাহুতি দেন তিনি। শীলা দেবী যে স্থানটিতে নিজেকে বিসর্জন করেন, সেটিই এখনো পর্যন্ত শীলা দেবীর ঘাট নামে পরিচিত। মতান্তরে অনেক সময় শীলা দেবীকে পরশুরামের মেয়ে নয়, বরং বোন হিসেবে জানা যায়।

পুণ্যবতী শীলা দেবীর ঘাটকেও পুণ্যলাভের স্থান হিসেবে দেখেন বহু হিন্দু ধর্মাবলম্বী। তাইতো প্রতি বছর জৈষ্ঠ্য মাসের শুক্লা দশমী তিথিতে এ ঘাটে পুণ্যস্নান হয়। পাপতাপ বিসর্জন দিতে লোকে আসে করতোয়ার জলে। এছাড়া প্রতি বারো বছর পরপর পৌষ নারায়ণী যোগেও বিশেষ পুণ্যস্নান হয় এখানে। কথিত আছে, করতোয়ার এ ঘাটে স্নান ও তিন রাত উপবাস করলে প্রাচীনকালের অশ্বমেধ যজ্ঞের সমান পুণ্য হয়।

কিন্তু ইতিহাসে পরশুরামের থাকা না থাকা নিয়েই যদি রহস্য থাকে, তবে তো শীলা দেবীর অস্তিত্বও সংকটাপন্ন। তাই মতান্তরে এ ঘাটের আরেকটি উৎপত্তিকথাও জানা যায়। অনেকে বলেন, স্থানটি একসময় নৌপথে আমদানি করে আনা বহু পাথর খালাস ও স্তূপীকৃত করে রাখার জন্য ব্যবহার করা হতো। আর সময়ের সাথে বদলে গিয়ে এর নাম হয় শিলা, অর্থাৎ পাথুরে দ্বীপ, যার পরিবর্তিত রূপই সম্ভবত শীলা দেবী এবং শীলা দেবীর ঘাট।

শীলা দেবীর ঘাটের আশেপাশে, সমগ্র মহাস্থান জুড়ে রয়েছে এমন বহু কিংবদন্তি, ইতিহাস-কল্পনার মিশেলে তৈরি বহু প্রত্নতাত্ত্বিক নিদর্শনের ছাপ। বাংলা লোকগাথার অন্যতম দুই চরিত্র বেহুলা-লখিন্দরের সঙ্গে জড়িত ‘লক্ষীন্দরের মেধ’ নামে একটি স্থানও আছে এখানে। করতোয়া নদীর পশ্চিম তীরে আরো পাওয়া যায় স্কন্ধমন্দির বা স্কন্ধের ধাপের কথা, যার সাথে জুড়ে আছে কিংবদন্তির অন্য সব গল্পকথা।

# **The Robinhood of Chalan Beel**

# **English**

The English officers were searching for girls from ordinary homes to take as gifts. It wasn’t just the officers; there were many soldiers and guards who needed to be pleased as well, and the landlord’s lackeys were tasked with this grim job. A young girl, recently married, was supposed to go to her husband’s home, but fate dealt her a cruel hand. Instead, she was being taken in a boat, led astray by the landlord’s men. Their intentions were anything but good. Just as the boat was about to dock at the Kacharibari ghat, out of nowhere, a boat with twenty-two oars appeared. With a fierce strike of spears, the landlord's boat was shattered into pieces.

"What happened? What happened?"

Everyone was utterly shocked, even the unfortunate girl. Then, a figure emerged from the shadows—a bandit. Most had never seen him before, but everyone knew his name. The bandit reassured the girl, saying, "Don't be afraid, sister. Get on my boat." The boat then sped away with the swiftness of an arrow, bringing the girl safely back to her father. With a raised hand, the father blessed the bandit, saying, "People will remember you for generations to come."

It was the late 19th century, a time of great turmoil across the country. The masses were awakening, driven by movements and revolts, shaking the balance between rulers and the oppressed. In the midst of this unrest, a Robin Hood figure emerged in the village of Nalka in Pabna. He was indeed the Robin Hood of the Chalan Beel. Taking from the rich and giving to the poor, no other name would suit him better. But he had a name of his own—Mahar Khan.

People say that Mahar Khan wasn't alone—he was rumored to be accompanied by a band of ghosts and spirits. How else could he appear out of nowhere, striking like a phantom in the night?

Maher Khan had no family left, and the ruthless zamindar's tyranny had stripped him of his ancestral home, which was eventually auctioned off. With nowhere else to turn, Maher sought solace by becoming a disciple of a Sufi saint. He spent several days with the saint, but the unrest in his heart never subsided.

All around him, he saw the rich exploiting and oppressing the poor, and it pained him deeply. Maher felt a strong urge to do something, to stand against injustice and help those who were suffering. This inner turmoil and sense of responsibility began to shape his path.

But the situation was far from straightforward. Maher decided that the only way to aid the poor was by taking wealth from the rich. He confided his plans to the Sufi saint, who warned him to avoid causing harm to innocent people, no matter what. With the saint's blessing, Maher Khan embarked on his mission.

"I've lost so much already, so I no longer fear losing anything else. But I swear, I will never take away the bread from an orphan or a poor person. Whatever wealth I acquire through my raids, I will distribute it all to the poor. And I'll regularly offer offerings at the shrine of the Sufi saint."

Mahar first joined a group of stick fighters. To resist, one must first become capable. So, he spent many days learning how to wield a stick and received training in various weapons. As Mahar became quite skilled, one day he encountered a cruel and oppressive landlord.

The landlord was making his way along the river with his entourage, accompanied by music and dancing courtesans. Suddenly, a boat with twenty-two oars swiftly approached and launched a surprise attack. The loud cries of the bandits shouting "Harere re re\!" echoed, abruptly silencing the music, dance, and festivities. The landlord's guards were thrown straight into the water, leaving the entire group in chaos and fear.

The bandits demanded nothing of gold or wealth; they only wanted the landlord. He was dragged out alone, and without a moment's hesitation, a club struck his head. In an instant, the landlord sank into the water, never to rise again. This marked the beginning, and from that moment on, Mohar Khan's relentless campaign never stopped.

Not just this one landlord, but all the tyrannical landlords in the region began to fear Mohar Khan. Boats laden with riches were looted, tax collections were seized from the land offices, and Mohar Khan would distribute the wealth among the poor. If he deemed that a landlord's sins had reached their limit, this fearless bandit would not hesitate to take their life.

Mohar's anger toward the landlords never waned, as it was their cruelty that had destroyed his own life. He spent the rest of his days as a protector of the poor, fighting against the very landlords who had wronged him. In return, he earned a life on the run, a fugitive with no place to call home.

Mohar Khan's robust physique was a testament to his rigorous training, which made him more formidable with each passing day. His eyes burned with a fierce intensity, so much so that anyone who found themselves under his piercing gaze would be instantly struck with fear and bewilderment.

Mahar Khan had made the landlords lose their sleep. Fearing him, the landlords’ men often searched for him, forcing Mahar to adopt various disguises. Once, while crossing the river in the guise of a regular traveler, Mahar spotted a poor Brahmin on the boat.

The Brahmin wiped his tears and spoke to the boatman, "You know, boatman, I went to ask for help from my patrons to arrange my daughter's marriage, but I got almost nothing. What will happen now, only God knows\!"

Mahar Khan, who was on the boat with his trusted companion Nasu, started chatting with the Brahmin. In the course of their conversation, the Brahmin mentioned the tale of Mahar Khan. The two listened and laughed, amused by the irony of the situation.

After the boat reached the shore, Mahar Khan called the Brahmin over and said, "Don't worry about your daughter's marriage. Here, take five hundred rupees. And on the day of the wedding, everything else you need will arrive in pots of curd."

As the day of the Brahmin's daughter's wedding approached, the father grew increasingly anxious. From the morning, he was restless, worrying whether trusting the words of an unknown man would doom his daughter's fate. But Mahar Khan, the notorious Dakat, was a man of his word. Despite his reputation for leading daring raids and striking fear into the hearts of landlords, he had a code of honor that he never broke.

Even though he had heard those stories, the Brahmin's hair stood on end with fear. As he worried and contemplated, he saw that the milkmen had arrived with the curd. They set aside three pots separately. One of the milkmen said, "Here, take all the money. Make sure your daughter has a good wedding."

As the milkman was about to leave, he paused, turned back, and asked, "Master, may I see your daughter? I once had a sister too, but I lost her to cholera." The Brahmin, moved by the words, replied, "You saved my honor. At least have a sweet. What’s your name, my son?" The bandit, disguised as a milkman, answered, "My name is Mohar Dakat, the name that makes people in this region tremble with fear. Farewell, Master." The Brahmin had never experienced such a miraculous event in his life. Such was the mysterious and fascinating character of Mohar Khan, the Robin Hood of Bengal.

"At the fear of Mohar Khan, life departs from the body."

But Mohar Khan never intended to scare ordinary people, nor did he want to. His anger was directed at the oppressors—those who exploited and cheated people, trampling over them just for money. His true aim was to punish those who committed such injustices.

Wherever Mohar Khan went and whatever he did, he never forgot his Saint's mantra. That’s why he had the power to become invisible whenever he wished. During British rule, there were numerous attempts to capture Mohar, and he frequently eluded the police. On one occasion, he was being taken away with his hands and feet shackled by a stern officer, but Mohar managed to devise a way to trick their eyes and escape.

Mohar Khan told the police, "Just hold onto my shackles for a moment; I want to take a proper bath before going to jail." Saying this, he submerged into the river and became invisible. After that, he was never seen again for a long time.

Ten days of the bandit and one day of the police. In the end, Mohar was caught. According to the law, the list of crimes under Mohar's name was not small. For extortion of taxes, banditry, attacks on landlords, and murder—cases were filed against Mohar at the Pubna District Court. But it was rare to see such a flood of people for a criminal. Everyone, except for the police, the judge, and the landlords, seemed to wish for Mohar's release. However, that was not to be. As punishment, Mohar Khan was sentenced to life imprisonment in exile. After that, there were no further reports on when he left the world behind.

Perhaps Mohar Khan spent his remaining days alone on that island, settling his accounts, or maybe he vanished using the powers of his Sufi Saint. The story of this bandit is shrouded in mystery and enigma, leaving behind a legacy wrapped in intrigue.

ইংরেজদের উপহার হিসেবে নিয়ে যেতে খোঁজা হচ্ছে সাধারণ ঘরের মেয়েদের। শুধু কি সাহেব? সাথে বহু সান্ত্রী-সিপাই আছে, সবাইকে খুশি করতে হবে– জমিদারের চ্যালারা এই কাজেই নিযুক্ত আছে। সদ্য বিয়ে হয়েছে একটি মেয়ের, তার যাবার কথা ছিল শ্বশুরবাড়ি। কিন্তু কপাল এমনই মন্দ, তাকে নৌকায় করে ভুল পথে নিয়ে যাচ্ছে জমিদারের চর। উদ্দেশ্য মোটেও ভালো নয়। কাছারিবাড়ির ঘাটে নৌকা ভিড়বে, এমন সময় কোত্থেকে যেন সেখানে উদয় হলো এক বাইশ ছিপের নৌকা। দুর্ধর্ষ বর্শার আঘাতে এই নৌকাটি ভেঙে খানখান হলো।

“হলো কী? হলো কী?”

সকলে ভীষণ অবাক। এমনকি সেই হতভাগী মেয়েটিও। তখন সামনে এসে দাঁড়ালো এক ডাকাত। তাকে দেখেনি অনেকেই, কিন্তু নাম শুনেছে সবাই। মেয়েটিকে নির্ভয় দিয়ে সে বললো, “ভয় পেও না বোন। আমার নৌকায় ওঠো।” তারপর সেই নৌকা তীরের চেয়ে দ্রুত গতিতে ছুটলো, গিয়ে দাঁড়ালো মেয়েটির বাবার কাছে। হাত তুলে আশীর্বাদ করলেন তিনি– “সবাই তোমাকে যুগ যুগ ধরে মনে রাখবে।”

সময়টা উনিশ শতকের শেষভাগ। দেশের সবদিকে তখন টালমাটাল অবস্থা। আন্দোলনে, আলোড়নে জনগণ জেগে উঠছে। শাসক-শোষিতের মধ্যকার ভারসাম্য নড়ে যাচ্ছে। আর এই অস্থির সময়েই পাবনার ‘নলকা’ গ্রামে এলো এক রবিনহুড। সে চলন বিলের রবিনহুডই বটে। ধনীর সম্পদ কেড়ে নিয়ে গরিবের মাঝে বিলি করে দেয়া এই দস্যুকে আর কোন নামই বা মানাবে? নাম তার নিজেরও একটা ছিল। মহর খাঁ।

লোকে এও বলে, মহর খাঁর সাথে নাকি একদল ভূত-প্রেত বাস করে। আর নইলে যেখানে সেখানে অমন ভূতের মতো হামলে পড়তে পারে নাকি?

## **বাংলা**

তিন কূলে মহরের কেউ ছিল না। জমিদারের অত্যাচারে তার ভিটেবাড়িটিও একদিন নিলামে নেই হয়ে যায়। এরপর কোনো কূলকিনারা না পেয়ে মহর যায় এক পীরের মুরিদ হতে। বেশ কিছুদিন সেখানে থাকলো, তবু মনের অশান্তি আর দূর হয় না। চারদিকে তখন গরিবের উপর ধনীর শোষণ-নিপীড়ন। এসব দেখে মহরের মন কেমন করে। সে কিছু একটা করতে চায়। কিন্তু সোজা আঙুলে ঘি বের হবার মতো অবস্থা তখন নেই। মহর ঠিক করলো, ধনীর সম্পদ কেড়ে নিয়েই গরীবকে সাহায্য করবে সে। পীরের কাছে সব কথা খুলে বললো। পীর তাকে সাবধান করে দিলেন, আর যাই করুক, কখনো যেন নিরীহ মানুষের ক্ষতি না করে। পীরের দোয়া নিয়ে মহর খাঁ নিজের অভিযানে বেরিয়ে পড়লো–

“হারিয়েছি অনেক কিছুই, তাই আর হারানোর কথা ভাবি না। তবে আমি কোনোদিন কোনো অনাথ, গরীবের ভাত মারবো না কোনোদিন। লুট করে যখন যা অর্থ পাব, সবই বিলিয়ে দেব গরীবের জন্য। নিয়মিত শিরনি দেব পীরের মাজারে।”

মহর গিয়ে প্রথমেই ভর্তি হলো এক লাঠিয়ালের দলে। প্রতিবাদ করতে হলে, আগে তো যোগ্য হয়ে উঠতে হবে। তাই বহুদিন ধরে লাঠি চালানো শিখলো, তালিম নিল অস্ত্রশিক্ষারও। এভাবেই মহর যখন বেশ অনেকটা পটু হয়ে উঠেছে, তখন একদিন দেখা হলো এক অত্যাচারী জমিদারের সাথে। জমিদার তার দলবল নিয়ে গানবাজনা করতে করতে এগিয়ে চলেছে নদীপথে, সাথে নাচছে বাঈজীর দল। তক্ষুনি এক বাইশ দাঁড়ের ছিপনৌকা এসে হঠাৎ আক্রমণ করলো। সেই দস্যুদলের ‘হারেরেরেরে’ ধ্বনি শুনে গান-বাজনা, নাচ সবই থেমে গেল। জমিদারের বরকন্দাজ গিয়ে পড়লো সোজা জলের মধ্যে। সোনাদানা কিছুই চাইলো না জমিদার দল, চাইলো শুধু জমিদারকে। একা ডেকে বের করে আনা হলো– আর তারপরই মাথায় লাঠির আঘাত। মুহূর্তও দেরি না করে জলের মধ্যে তলিয়ে গেল জমিদার। সেই থেকে শুরু, এরপর আর থামেনি মহর খাঁর অভিযান।

শুধু এই জমিদারই নয়। তল্লাটের সকল অত্যাচারী জমিদারই ভয় পেতে শুরু করে মহর খাঁকে। নৌকা লুট হয়ে যাওয়া, কাছারিবাড়িতে এসে খাজনা তুলে নিয়ে তারপর গরিবদের মধ্যে বিলিয়ে দেয় মহর খাঁ। আর যে জমিদারের পাপের ঘড়া পূর্ণ হয়েছে বলে মনে হয়, তাকে প্রাণে মারতেও পিছপা হয় না এই দুঃসাহসী দস্যু। নিজের কপাল পুড়েছে জমিদারের কারণে, তাই জমিদারদের উপর রাগ তার কমেনি জীবনেও। গরিবদের রক্ষাকর্তা হয়েই বাকিটা সময় কাটায় মহর। বিনিময়ে পায় এক ফেরারী জীবন, এক পলাতক ভাগ্য।

মহর খাঁর পেটা শরীর। নিয়মিত চর্চায় দিন দিন আরো দক্ষ হয়ে চলেছে সে। চোখে যেন তার আগুন জ্বলে। মহর খাঁ যার দিকে সেই দুটো চোখ দিয়ে তাকাতো, তারা নিমেষেই হতবিহব্বল হয়ে যেত।

জমিদারদের রাতের ঘুম হারাম করে দিয়েছে সে। তাই তার পেছনে প্রায়ই তখন জমিদারের দল তন্ন তন্ন করে ঘুরে বেড়াচ্ছে। ফলে নিতে হয় ছদ্মবেশ। একবার সাধারণ যাত্রীর ছদ্মবেশে খেয়াপার হচ্ছিল মহর, নৌকায় দেখতে পেল এক গরীব বামুনকে। বামুন চোখের জল মুছছে আর খেয়া পাটনীকে বলছে, “জানো মাঝি, মেয়ের বিয়ে দেব বলে যজমানদের কাছে সাহায্য চাইতে গেছিলাম। কিন্তু তেমন কিছুই জুটলো না। কী হবে, ভগবানই জানেন\!” মহরের সাথে ছিল তার প্রধান সাগরেদ নসু। দুয়ে মিলে বামুনের সাথে গল্প জুড়ে দিল। কথায় কথায় বামুন বললো, মহর খাঁর গল্প। তারা শোনে আর হাসে।

এমনি করেই খেয়া পার হলো। পার হবার পর মহর সেই ব্রাহ্মণটিকে ডেকে বললো, “মেয়ের বিয়ে নিয়ে করো না। এই নাও পাঁচশো টাকা। আর বিয়ের দিন বাকি সবকিছু পৌঁছে যাবে দইয়ের হাঁড়িতে করে।”

দেখতে দেখতে বামুনের মেয়ের বিয়ের তারিখ এলো। সকাল থেকেই চিন্তায় অস্থির বাবা– অচেনা লোকের কথায় ভরসা করে মেয়ের কপাল পুড়বে না তো? কিন্তু না, মহর ডাকাত কথা দিয়ে কথা রাখতে জানে। তবে ব্রাহ্মণ তো মহরকে চেনে না। শুধু তার নাম শুনেছে, আর শুনেছে দাপিয়ে বেড়ানো সব আক্রমণের কথা। ওসব কথা শুনলেও ভয়ে বামুনের গায়ের লোম দাঁড়িয়ে যায়। সাতপাঁচ ভাবতে ভাবতে বামুন দেখলো, দই নিয়ে গোয়ালারা এসেছে। এর মধ্যে তিনটি পাতিল আলাদা করে রেখে দিল তারা। একজন গোয়ালা বললো, “এই যে সব টাকা বুঝে নাও। ভালো করে মেয়ের বিয়ে দাও।” এই বলে সে চলেই যাচ্ছিল, কী যেন ভেবে একটু ফিরে এসে বললো, “কর্তা, তোমার মেয়েটিকে একটু দেখতে পারি? আমারও একটা বোন ছিল। কলেরা রোগে তাকে হারিয়েছি।” সব শুনে ব্রাহ্মণ বললো, “আমার মুখ রক্ষা করলে তুমি। একটি মিষ্টি অন্তত মুখে দাও। তোমার নাম কী বাবা?” গোয়ালাবেশে দস্যু উত্তর দিল, “আমার নাম মহর ডাকাত, যার নাম শুনলে এ তল্লাটে লোকে ভয়ে কাঁপে। চলি কর্তা।” ব্রাহ্মণের জীবনে এমন আশ্চর্য ঘটনা আর ঘটেনি। এমনই অদ্ভুত চরিত্র ছিল মহর খাঁ, বাংলার রবিনহুড।

“মহর খাঁর ডরে– প্রাণ থাকে না ধড়ে।”

কিন্তু সাধারণ লোকের ভয় পাওয়ার কোনো কাজ মহর খাঁ করতো না, করতে চাইতও না। তার রাগ ছিল জুলুমবাজদের প্রতি। যারা লোককে ঠকিয়ে খায়, শুধু টাকার জন্য মানুষকে পায়ের নিচে রাখে– তাদেরকে শাস্তি দেয়াই ছিল তার আসল লক্ষ্য।

মহর খাঁ যেখানেই যায়, যা-ই করে, সে তার পীরের মন্ত্র কখনো ভুলে যায়নি। তাইতো যখন ইচ্ছে অদৃশ্য হবার শক্তিও আছে তার। ব্রিটিশ রাজত্বে মহরকে ধরার চেষ্টা বহুবার করা হয়েছে, প্রায় সময়ই সে পুলিশের চোখ ফাঁকি দিয়ে পালিয়ে যেত। একবার তাকে হাতে-পায়ে ভালোমতো শেকল পরিয়ে নিয়ে যাচ্ছিল কড়া এক দারোগা, কিন্তু তখুনি তাদের চোখকে ফাঁকি দেয়ার ব্যবস্থা করলো মহর। পুলিশকে বললো, “একটু আমার শেকলটা ধরে রাখুন না, জেলে যাবার আগে ভালো করে একটু গোসল করে যাই।” এই বলে নদীতে ডুব দিয়ে অদৃশ্য হয়ে যায় দস্যু মহর। এরপর বহুদিন তার আর দেখা মেলেনি।

ডাকাতের দশদিন আর পুলিশের একদিন। শেষমেশ ধরা পড়লো মহর। আইনমতে অপরাধের সংখ্যা তো আর মহরের নামে কম লেখা ছিল না। খাজনা লুট, দস্যুবৃত্তি, জমিদারদের আক্রমণ, হত্যা– এসবের জন্য পাবনা সদরকোর্টে মহরের নামে কেস উঠলো। কিন্তু কোনো অপরাধীর জন্য এমন মানুষের ঢল কমই দেখা গেছে। পুলিশ, জজ আর জমিদারসমাজ ছাড়া সকলেই যেন চেয়েছিল, মহর মুক্তি পাক। কিন্তু তেমনটা হয়নি। শাস্তি হিসেবে মহর খাঁর যাবজ্জীবন দ্বীপান্তর হলো। এরপর কবে সে পৃথিবীর মায়া ছেড়ে চলে গেছে, সে খবর আর জানা যায়নি। হয়তো সেই দ্বীপেই একাকি মহর খাঁ সারাজীবনের হিসেব-নিকেশ মিটিয়েছিল, কিংবা পীরের মন্ত্রবলে উধাও হয়ে গিয়েছিল। মহর দস্যুর গল্পটা এমনই ধোঁয়াশায় মাখা, রহস্যঘেরা।

# **The legend of Ghashi Dewan of Cholon Bil**

# **English**

About 500 years ago, Shah Makhdum (RA) journeyed from the distant lands of Arabia, through Yemen, to finally settle in Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Accompanying him was Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA). Shah Makhdum (RA) was a revered Islamic saint who, along with numerous disciples, came to this region to spread the teachings of Islam. Among his followers, some dedicated themselves to spreading Islam, while others devoted their lives to serving humanity. Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA) was one of the most notable among them.

He devoted himself to serving humanity in the sacred land of Chalan Beel, which is renowned as the land of the Baro Auliya (twelve saints). His arrival in this region was guided by divine inspiration and the instructions of Shah Makhdum Baba. Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA) traveled from Rajshahi, passing through Natore, and eventually arrived in Singra, a thana within the Natore subdivision. From there, he wandered until he reached a small piece of land between Satpukuria Hijli and Dahiya.

To determine the nature of the crop, Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA) put a single sesame seed into his mouth. Immediately, a divine message was revealed to him: "O great man, whose crop have you eaten without permission?" Troubled by this, Baba began searching for the owner of the land. He eventually discovered that the owner was Kali Pada Ghosh from the Dahiya area. Baba, feeling remorseful, hurried to Ghosh's home and asked for forgiveness for eating just one sesame seed. In return, he expressed his willingness to work for the Ghosh family for 12 years as a way of atonement.

Ghosh quickly realized that Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA) was no ordinary person and agreed to employ him according to the proposed terms. Baba was assigned the task of cutting grass at Ghosh Mahashay's household. Kali Pada Ghosh was involved in the curd business and owned many milk-producing cows. Every day, Baba would take a boat, go out to cut grass, and then return to the Ghosh household with the boat fully loaded with grass.

Many people saw Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA) sleeping on the boat, with his head at one end and his feet at the other. Such was his miraculous power, which later led to him being known as "Ghasi Dewan." However, there is little information about his real name. After working for 12 years without any wages at the Ghosh household, Baba bid farewell to Kali Pada Ghosh and set out once again on a journey to the unknown.

In the heart of Chalan Beel, near the spot where Baba Ghasi Dewan's (RA) shrine is located, there used to be a dangerous whirlpool. Anyone who fell into it was doomed, with no chance of escape. One day, as Baba was passing by this perilous place, he noticed a dead cow floating in the water. He stopped his boat and began eating the raw meat from the carcass. Coincidentally, two young boys were sitting on a nearby jungle-covered mound, witnessing this strange event.

One of the boys was the son of a fisherman, and the other was the son of a barber. Seeing Baba Ghasi Dewan eating the raw meat, they were both puzzled. When they spoke to Baba, he offered them the meat as well, and without hesitation, they ate it. Baba Ghasi Dewan, with his miraculous powers, could make the impossible seem possible, performing such extraordinary acts with ease.

From that moment on, the two boys became devoted followers of Baba Ghasi Dewan. Even today, their graves are located beside Baba's at the shrine. Baba Ghasi Dewan made that dense, jungle-covered mound his dwelling, and over time, it gained popularity. People from various places began visiting just to catch a glimpse of him.

The place in the heart of Chalan Beel remains highly popular even today. Thousands of people visit the shrine, hoping for their various wishes and desires to be fulfilled.

# **The tale of Sakhina Bibi**

# **English**

Many years ago, in the village of Kella Tajpur in Mymensingh, lived a Mughal nobleman named Omar Khan. He had a daughter named Sakhina. Unlike other girls of her age, Sakhina didn’t play with dolls. Instead, she had the desire to become a warrior, and she received ample training to fulfill that dream.

In the history of Bengal, the Baro-Bhuiyans were a group of landlords who rebelled against the Mughal Empire to defend the independence of their regions. Among them, the most famous was Isa Khan. He was entrusted with the responsibility of Jangalbari.

Dewan Firoz Khan was the successor of Isa Khan. He governed a vast area in Kishoreganj, located about four miles from Jangalbari. After the death of Isa Khan, Firoz Khan sought to continue his grandfather’s struggle against the Mughals. The atmosphere was tense, with the constant threat of conflict looming over them every day.

Firoz Khan's mother, Amma Begum, was not particularly supportive of his constant involvement in battles. Having witnessed a lifetime of war, she yearned for peace in her later years. One day, she summoned the vizier and expressed her concern: "Vizier Sahib, I am deeply worried about Firoz. If we could arrange his marriage, perhaps he would focus more on his home and less on the endless pursuit of freedom outside. Maybe he will find happiness within the confines of his own household."

And so began the search for a bride for Firoz. Proposals started pouring in from various zamindar families, accompanied by gifts. Firoz Khan was presented with numerous portraits of potential brides, but none of them captured his interest. Then, suddenly, his eyes fell on a picture that had been set aside.

His attention was immediately drawn to the portrait of a young woman, riding a black horse, her eyes blazing as she held up a sword. Firoz couldn’t tear his gaze away. This was exactly what he had been looking for—not just the gentleness of a woman, but the spirit of rebellion that she embodied.

The fiery spirit of rebellion shone brightly in this young woman—perhaps she could be the perfect companion for the freedom-loving Firoz. He bought the portrait from the matchmaker at a high price and then hung it beside his grandfather’s picture, encased in a gleaming golden frame on the wall.

The daring girl in the portrait was none other than Sakhina Bibi, the warrior daughter of Kella Tajpur. Hours would pass as Firoz gazed at the image of Sakhina, sword raised high, her fierce expression captivating him. Days went by like this, and before he even realized it, Firoz found himself deeply in love with Sakhina.

After spending so much time with the portrait, Firoz Khan felt it was time to meet the real person. With this thought in mind, he disguised himself as a fakir and arrived at Kella Tajpur. At that time, Sakhina's father, Omar Khan, was not in good health. Under the guise of a fakir, Firoz's sweet words and attentive care helped Omar Khan recover significantly.

After spending so much time with the portrait, Firoz Khan felt it was time to meet the real person. With this thought in mind, he disguised himself as a fakir and arrived at Kella Tajpur. At that time, Sakhina's father, Omar Khan, was not in good health. Under the guise of a fakir, Firoz's sweet words and attentive care helped Omar Khan recover significantly.

However, despite spending so much time in the palace, Firoz never got a chance to meet Sakhina. Ironically, just when he was about to leave with a heavy heart, fate intervened. On that very day, he encountered Sakhina at the pond's edge in the fort. Their eyes met, and a silent conversation took place between them, a conversation known to no one else. Firoz simply said, “At the pond's edge, with my own tears, I leave my heart’s message for you, Sakhina.”

Sakhina’s father, Omar Khan, was aligned with the Mughal side, while Firoz's entire lineage had fought for independence throughout their lives. From the very beginning, there was a fundamental problem. Upon learning Firoz’s true identity, Omar Khan flatly rejected the relationship.

Firoz's mother sent a marriage proposal, but Omar Khan rejected it. With no other options, Firoz decided to attack Killa Tajpur, rescue Sakhina, and then both of them fled and married. They settled in Jangalbari.

Upon learning of the marriage, Omar Khan declared war against Jangalbari. After a significant battle along the banks of the Narsunda River, Firoz was captured. However, his soldiers continued to fight as much as they could.

Meanwhile, Sakina eagerly awaited Firoz. Her heart was confident that her husband would emerge victorious in the battle. Thus, she sprinkled fragrant rosewater along the path, preparing a variety of sweets and delicacies to be distributed among the villagers.

But where was Firoz? Dressed in a red sari, Sakina looked like a bride anew. At that moment, news arrived from the battlefield: Firoz Khan had been captured. Upon hearing this, the new bride Sakina Bibi immediately transformed into a warrior. She donned her battle gear once more and prepared to lead the troops in Firoz Khan's absence.

No matter what, the fight had to continue. Sakina Bibi, mounted on a white horse, charged out of the Jangalbari fort with determination. Fearlessly, she led her troops into battle. Seeing Sakina on the battlefield reinvigorated the despondent soldiers with new hope. They surged from the Narsunda River to the Shuriya River, turning the waters red with blood. Crossing this river would bring them to Sakina's father's home, where her beloved Firoz was being held captive.

Sakina, ready to drive out all enemies and head to the fort, was suddenly met with a white flag from the opposing side—a sign of peace. Did Omar Khan surrender? As hope began to rise, a messenger arrived with the news: “There is no need for further fighting, Sakina Bibi.” “Firoz Khan has given you a divorce.” Sakina saw the divorce decree, signed by Firoz himself. The bloodshed along the banks of the Shuria River, the struggle for freedom—had it all been for nothing? Was this the betrayal she faced?

Sakina fell slowly from the horse’s back, the commander’s attire slipping from her shoulders. Betrayed, she felt as though a venomous snake had struck her forehead. Thus, Sakina's name vanished from the world. However, in the village of Kumrigram, where she met her end, there still stands a shrine in her memory—Sakina Bibi's mausoleum.

Did Firuz really divorce her? Or was it all a cunning ploy by Sakina's father? Perhaps he did not realize that his scheme would lead to the loss of his own daughter's life. At the shrine built in Sakina's name, it is said that a dervish would often come in the evening, lighting a lamp and shedding tears on Sakina's grave. Though no one knew, it can be inferred that this dervish was none other than the devoted Firuz Khan.

বহু বছর আগে ময়মনসিংহের কেল্লা তাজপুর গ্রামে বাস করতেন মুঘল মসনবদার ওমর খাঁ। তারই মেয়ে ছিল সখিনা। ছোট থেকেই সখিনা অন্য সব মেয়ের মতো পুতুল নিয়ে খেলতো না। তার ইচ্ছে ছিল যোদ্ধা হওয়া। যথেষ্ট প্রশিক্ষণও সে নেয়।

বাংলার ইতিহাসে মুঘল সম্রাটের বিরুদ্ধে নিজ নিজ অঞ্চলের স্বাধীনতায় যে জমিদাররা বিদ্রোহ করতেন, তারাই ছিলেন বারো ভূঁইয়া। এদের মধ্যে সবচেয়ে বিখ্যাত ছিলেন ঈশা খাঁ। জঙ্গলবাড়ির দায়িত্ব ছিল ঈশা খাঁর উপর।

ঈশা খাঁর উত্তরসূরী ছিল দেওয়ান ফিরোজ খাঁ। জঙ্গলবাড়ি থেকে চার মাইল দূরে কিশোরগঞ্জের এক বিশাল এলাকা জুড়ে ছিল তার দেওয়ানি। ঈশা খাঁর মৃত্যুর পর ফিরোজ খাঁ মুঘলদের সাথে তার নানার লড়াই চালিয়ে যেতে চাইল। প্রতিদিনই যুদ্ধ যুদ্ধ ভাব। প্রতিদিনই অশনি সংকেত। এসবে ফিরোজ খাঁর মায়ের অবশ্য তেমন একটা মত ছিল না। সারা জীবন ধরেই তিনি শুধু যুদ্ধ দেখে এসেছেন, শেষ বয়সে তার চাই একটু শান্তি। একদিন আম্মা বেগম ডেকে পাঠালেন উজিরকে, “উজির সাহেব, ফিরোজকে নিয়ে আমার বড় চিন্তা হয়। ওর একটা বিয়েথা দেয়া গেলে হয়তো ঘরে মন ফিরবে। তখন আর বাইরের স্বাধীনতা নিয়ে ছেলে আমার দিনভর মাথার ঘাম পায়ে ফেলবে না, ঘরেই সুখ খুঁজে নেবে।”

সেই থেকে শুরু হলো ফিরোজের জন্য কনে দেখা। বহু জমিদারের বাড়ি থেকে উপহারসহ বিয়ের প্রস্তাব আসতে থাকলো। একে একে অনেক জমিদারকন্যার ছবি দেখলেন, কিন্তু ফিরোজ খাঁয়ের মন উঠলো না। হঠাৎ এক পাশে সরিয়ে রাখা একটি ছবির দিকে চোখ পড়লো ফিরোজের। তার নজর কাড়লো কালো ঘোড়ায় সওয়ার, হাতে তরবারি উঠিয়ে জ্বলজ্বল চোখে চেয়ে থাআ এক তরুণীর ছবি। কিছুতেই চোখ ফেরাতে পারলো না ফিরোজ। এই তো চেয়েছে সে। নারীরূপে শুধু কমনীয়তা নয়, তার চাই বিদ্রোহও। এই তরুণীর মধ্যে সেই বিদ্রোহ ঝলমল করে উঠছে– হয়তো সেই হতে পারে স্বাধীনতাকামী ফিরোজের যোগ্য সঙ্গিনী। ঘটকের কাছ থেকে ছবিটি চড়া মূল্যে কিনে নিলো ফিরোজ। এরপর টাঙিয়ে রাখলো তার নানাভাইয়ের ছবির পাশে, দেয়ালে ঝলমল এক সোনার ফ্রেমে।

ছবির সেই ডানপিটে মেয়েটি ছিল সখিনা বিবি, কেল্লা তাজপুরের যুদ্ধবাজ কন্যা। ঘণ্টার পর ঘণ্টা কেটে যেত, ফিরোজ শুধু দেয়ালে তলোয়ার উঁচিয়ে থাকা সখিনার দিকেই তাকিয়ে থাকতো। এভাবে দিনকতক কেটে গেল। নিজের মনের অজান্তেই সখিনার প্রেমে পড়ে গেলো ফিরোজ। অনেক তো ছবির সাথে সময় কাটলো, এইবারে আসল মানুষটাকেও তো দেখা চাই\! এই ভেবে একদিন কিলা তাজপুরে ফকিরের ছদ্মবেশে এলো ফিরোজ খাঁ। সে সময়ে সখিনার বাবা ওমর খাঁয়ের শরীরটা ভালো যাচ্ছিল না। ফকিরের বেশে ফিরোজের মিষ্টিমধুর কথায়, শুশ্রুষায় অনেকটাই সেরে উঠলেন ওমর খাঁ। তবে এতদিন মহলে সময় কাটিয়েও সখিনার দেখা পেলো না ফিরোজ। ভাগ্যের কী পরিহাস– মনে দুঃখ নিয়ে চলে যাবেন, সেদিনই কিলার পুকুরঘাটে দেখা হয়ে গেল সখিনার সাথে। চোখে চোখ পড়লো। চোখের ভাষায় কথাও হলো। সে কথা আর কোনো কাকপক্ষীরও জানা নেই। মুখে শুধু একটি কথাই বললো ফিরোজ, দিঘির ঘাটে নিজের দু ফোঁটা চোখের জলে সখিনাকে বলে যাচ্ছেন মনের কথা।

সখিনার বাবা ওমর খাঁ মুঘল পক্ষের, ওদিকে ফিরোজের পুরো বংশ সারা জীবন স্বাধীনতার জন্য লড়ে গেছে। গোড়াতেই গলদ হলো। ফিরোজের পরিচয় জানার পর ওমর খাঁ কোনোভাবেই এ সম্পর্ক মেনে নিলেন না। ফিরোজের মা বিয়ের প্রস্তাব পাঠালেও প্রত্যাখ্যান করে দেন তিনি। আর উপায় না দেখে তখন কেল্লা তাজপুরে আক্রমণ চালায় ফিরোজ, সখিনাকে উদ্ধার করে। এরপর দুজনে পালিয়ে বিয়ে করে জঙ্গলবাড়িতে গিয়ে ওঠে।

বিয়ের খবর পেয়ে ওমর খাঁ যুদ্ধ ঘোষণা করলেন জঙ্গলবাড়ির বিরুদ্ধে। নরসুন্দা নদীর তীরে ফিরোজের ছোট সেনাবাহিনীর সঙ্গে বেশ অনেকটা লড়াইয়ের পর বন্দী হলো ফিরোজ। সৈন্যরা তবু যতটুকু সম্ভব যুদ্ধ চালিয়ে গেলো।

ওদিকে সখিনা অপেক্ষায় প্রহর গুনছে ফিরোজের। সখিনার মন বলছে, যুদ্ধে তার স্বামীরই জয় হবে। তাইতো সুগন্ধি গোলাপজল ছিটিয়ে পথ চেয়ে আছে সে। গ্রামের সকলের মধ্যে নানান রকম মিষ্টি-মন্ডা বিতরণের জন্য প্রস্তুত করা আছে। কিন্তু কই, ফিরোজ তো এলো না\! লাল শাড়ি পরে সখিনা আজ যেন একেবারে নতুন বউ। তখনই যুদ্ধক্ষেত্র থেকে খবর এলো, বন্দী হয়েছে ফিরোজ খাঁ। এ খবর শুনে নববধূ সখিনা বিবি মুহূর্তেই হয়ে উঠলো যুদ্ধের সিপাহী। গুছিয়ে রাখা যুদ্ধসাজ আবারো গায়ে জড়ালো। ফিরোজ খাঁয়ের অনুপস্থিতিতে সেই হবে সেনাপতি। যে করেই হোক, লড়াই চালিয়ে যেতে হবে। সাদা ঘোড়ায় চড়ে জঙ্গলবাড়ির দুর্গ থেকে টগবগ করে ছুটে চললো সখিনা বিবি। কাউকে ভয় নেই তার। সখিনাকে যুদ্ধক্ষেত্রে পেয়ে হতাশ সৈন্যরাও যেন নতুন করে আশার আলো খুঁজে পেলো। নরসুন্দা থেকে শুরিয়া নদী পর্যন্ত দাপিয়ে বেড়ালো সৈন্যরা। রক্তে লাল হয়ে গেল নদীর জল। এই নদী পার হলেই সখিনার বাবার বাড়ি। সেখানেই বন্দী করে রাখা আছে তার প্রিয়তম ফিরোজকে।

সব শত্রুকে হটিয়ে কেল্লায় যাওয়ার জন্য প্রস্তুত সখিনা। এমন সময়ই অপর পক্ষ থেকে দেখা গেল সাদা পতাকা। শান্তির নিশান। তবে কি ওমর খাঁ হার মেনে নিলেন? একটু আশার সঞ্চার হতেই দূত খবর দিল, “আর যুদ্ধের প্রয়োজন নেই সখিনা বিবি। ফিরোজ খাঁ আপনাকে তালাক দিয়েছেন।” তালাকের দলিল হাতে নিয়ে দেখলো, এ ফিরোজেরই হস্তাক্ষর। যার জন্য এত মানুষের রক্ত বয়ে গেল শুরিয়া নদীর তীরে, সেই তবে ধোঁকা দিলো?

ধীরে ধীরে ঘোড়ার পিঠ থেকে গড়িয়ে পড়লো সখিনার শরীর। খসে পড়লো সেনাপতির পোশাক। প্রতারণার ঘায়ে সখিনার মনে হলো, কোনো বিষধর সাপ তার কপালে দংশন করেছে। এভাবেই পৃথিবী থেকে হারিয়ে গেল সখিনার নাম। তবে যেখানে সখিনার মৃত্যু হয়েছিল, সেই কুমড়িগ্রামে আজো আছে সখিনা বিবির মাজার।

তবে ফিরোজ কি সত্যিই তাকে তালাক দিয়েছিল? না, এ সবই ছিল সখিনার পিতার কূট-কৌশল। কিন্তু তিনি হয়তো জানতেন না, তার এ ষড়যন্ত্রে নিজের মেয়েই প্রাণ হারাবে। সখিনার নামে গড়ে ওঠা সেই মাজারে প্রায়ই নাকি এক দরবেশ এসে সন্ধেবেলা বাতি জ্বালিয়ে যেত আর চোখের জলে ভিজিয়ে রাখতো সখিনার কবর। কেউ না জানলেও বুঝে নেয়া যায় সেই দরবেশ আর কেউ নয়, ছিল এক দেওয়ানা দেওয়ান– ফিরোজ খাঁ।

# **The Witch’s Dinner**

# **English**

That was long ago. At the edge of a small village lived a shepherd boy and his mother. They barely managed to get by, tending to their cows and sheep. One day, the shepherd boy had a strong craving for some pitha (traditional rice cakes). But when he went to his mother and expressed his wish, she snapped at him, "We barely have enough to eat every day, and you want pitha? Making pitha requires so many things\! Where will we get them, where will we find them?" Hearing this, the boy quickly replied, "Write down a list of what you need. I'll go and get everything. Then you can make pitha for me." And so, no sooner said than done. His mother handed him the shopping list and said:

"For the pitha, bring some sugar,

Make sure the grains are superfine.

For the pitha, bring some milk,

So fresh that no one’s had a sip.

For the pitha, we need rice flour,

But don't bring any rice bran, not even a trace\!"

But the young shepherd didn't have a single coin, so how would he bring all those things? Even though he had no money, the shepherd boy was clever and full of ideas. So, he started thinking of another plan.

He marched the herd straight into the paddy field. Instead of grass, the cows feasted on the paddy stalks. After letting the cows devour a significant portion of the crop, the shepherd boy returned home with them. Afterward, the boy began to beat the cows hard, forcing them to regurgitate the food they had eaten. He then collected the regurgitated food, and his mother cleaned it thoroughly. She sorted the rice, dried it, and then pounded it to make rice flour.

Now, milk was needed. But the cows weren't his own, so he couldn't just milk them—he’d get scolded by the owner if he tried. So, the shepherd boy came up with another clever idea. He went to a spot on the road that led up the hill in the village, and there, he poured a lot of water to make the ground muddy. So that anyone passing by would slip and fall. The shepherd was quite the mischievous one. Everything fell into place perfectly. When the village milkman was passing by with his milk, he slipped into the muddy trap the shepherd had prepared. The milk container shattered into pieces.

Meanwhile, the shepherd, sneaking past the milkman, filled his own milk container. Singing “Taire Naire Na” (a traditional song), he went home and handed the milk to his mother, then used the same cunning to procure sugar. His mother was very pleased. She thought her son had become quite resourceful, gathering all the ingredients beautifully. Now, she was ready to make the best pitha ever.

The shepherd ate all the pithas by himself, leaving just one large piece. After resting for a while, he dug a hole in a good spot in the field and buried the piece of pitha. Within a few days, a sprout emerged from the buried pitha, growing into a huge pitha tree. On each branch of the tree, hot pithas hung like mangoes. Delighted that he would never have to worry about pithas again, the shepherd swung his legs joyfully under the tree. Just then, an old, haggard woman appeared. The shepherd was unaware that she was actually a witch.

The shepherd, now having plenty of pithas, didn't hesitate to share.

“Alright, Grandma, I'll give you a pitha. But how will you take it?”

“Just place it in my hand,” the old woman replied.

“But the pitha is too hot. It might burn your hand.”

“Then put it in my mouth,” she suggested.

“Oh, Grandma, you don’t understand\! The pitha is still hot. It could burn your mouth.”

The old woman slowly pulled out a large sack and said, "Son, then please put the pitha in this bag. Oh, what a wonderful smell\! I haven't had a pitha in so long."

Hearing the sweet words of the old woman, the herdsman plucked a pitha and was about to put it in the sack when suddenly, the old woman grabbed him by the neck and, with a swift move, stuffed the entire boy into the sack. Before the herdsman could even comprehend what was happening, it was all over. After that, the witch, in a burst of joy, started singing in a shrill, eerie voice as she made her way through the forest:

"Hau Mau Kau,

Is anyone listening out there now?

If I find a human, quick as can be,

I'll gobble them up, gulp, and glee,

Tonight will be a feast for me\!"

As the witch continued singing her eerie song, she began to feel extremely thirsty. Despite being a witch, she wasn’t as strong as she used to be and quickly became exhausted. She left the sack under a tree and went to fetch some water.

At that very moment, a group of young shepherds was passing by along the forest path.The shepherd boys, hoping to find something valuable, opened the witch's sack and immediately saw that it was their friend inside. They quickly rescued him and replaced him with pebbles, stones, pieces of wood, and other trash. When the witch returned home, she excitedly told everyone,

"Today, I've caught a strong young man. Tonight's meal is going to be a feast\!"

But where was the young man? The sack contained only pebbles and stones. The witch got very angry. She was determined to teach the shepherd boy a lesson. The next day, she went back to the pitha tree. She managed to sweet-talk the shepherd boy into giving her a pitha again.

But did the old woman really want to eat the pitha? Her eyes were fixed on the shepherd boy. As soon as the boy started filling the sack with pitha, the old woman seized him by the neck and quickly stuffed him into the sack again. The shepherd boy realized there was no escape this time.

The old woman took the sack home and told her daughter-in-law, "Make sure to wash, cut, and cook everything properly before we all return home. We should have the food ready as soon as we get back." The shepherd boy, sitting inside the sack, overheard everything and began devising a plan in his mind.

As soon as the little witch opened the sack, the shepherd boy spoke, "Ugh, your teeth are so disgusting\! With teeth like that, your husband will run away." The little witch was quite naive and immediately covered her teeth, saying, "How can my teeth be as white and shiny as yours? Tell me, please." The shepherd boy then said, "It's not that difficult\! Just heat up some strong oil and bring a funnel."

Then the oil was heated up on the stove, and the shepherd boy continued to think of his next plan. When the oil was bubbling hot, he misled the little witch and poured all the hot oil into her mouth using the funnel. The little witch was burned and scalded by the boiling oil.

Then, the shepherd boy cleaned her up, cooked her properly, and dressed in her jewelry and clothes while waiting for the big witch. At night, when everyone sat down to eat, they were served the cooked meat of the witch's little daughter. No one realized what they were eating. Everyone thought it was just the meat of the shepherd boy who had been so troublesome.

After the meal, the shepherd boy, in the guise of the little witch, and the old witch went to the riverbank to wash their hands. As soon as they finished washing, the shepherd boy suddenly jumped into the river. The old witch was taken aback\!

“Oh, wife, don’t go\! There are crocodiles in the river. Don’t go\!”

The shepherd boy then turned around and said, “You miserable old woman, who is your wife\! See what's inside your belly\!”

Saying this, the shepherd boy swam swiftly back home, leaving the crocodiles behind. The witch was so defeated that she never even went near the pitha tree again.

## **বাংলা**

সে বেশ অনেকদিন আগের কথা। ছোট্ট এক গাঁয়ের ধারে বাস করতো এক রাখাল বালক আর তার মা। গরু-ভেড়া চড়িয়ে কোনোমতে তাদের দিন কেটে যাচ্ছিল। একদিন রাখালের বড় ইচ্ছে করলো পিঠা খাবে। কিন্তু মায়ের কাছে গিয়ে বলতেই মা মুখ ঝামটা দিয়ে বললো– “দিন আনতে দিন খাই, পিঠা বানাতে কতকিছু চাই\! কোথায় পাই, কোথায় পাই?” মায়ের কথা শুনে সে তক্ষুনি জবাব দিলো, “তুমি ফর্দ লিখে দাও। আমি সবকিছু নিয়ে আসছি। এরপর তুমি আমায় পিঠা বানিয়ে দিও।” যে-ই কথা সে-ই কাজ। মা বাজারের ফর্দ হাতে ধরিয়ে দিলো–

“পিঠার জন্য এনো চিনি, হবে তার দানা মিহি। পিঠার জন্য এনো দুধ, যেন কেউ না দেয় তাতে মুখ। পিঠার জন্য চাই যে চালের গুঁড়া, এনো না যেন চালের কুঁড়া\!”

কিন্তু রাখালের কাছে তো একটি পয়সা নেই, সে এতসব জিনিস আনবে কীভাবে? পয়সা না থাকলেও অবশ্য রাখাল বালকটির বুদ্ধির শেষ ছিল না। তাই সে অন্য ফন্দি আঁটলো।

গরুর পাল নিয়ে সে হট হট করে পৌঁছে গেল ধানক্ষেতে। ঘাসের জায়গায় গরুরা সব খেলো ধানের ছড়া। ক্ষেতের অনেকখানি ধানগাছ সাবাড় করে দিয়ে রাখাল তাদের নিয়ে বাড়ি ফিরলো। এরপর গরুদেরকে খুব জোরে জোরে মারতে লাগলো, যাতে করে তারা সব খাবার উগড়ে দেয়। এরপর সেই উগড়ে দেয়া খাবার পরিষ্কার করে রাখালের মা চাল বাছলো, চাল শুকোতে দিয়ে কুটনায় কুটলো। তবেই হলো চালের গুঁড়া।

এবারে তো দুধ চাই। কিন্তু গরু তো তার নিজের নয়, চাইলেই দুধ দোয়াতে পারবে না– উল্টো ধ্যাতানি খেতে হবে মনিবের কাছে। তাই এজন্য রাখাল আরেক বুদ্ধি করলো। গাঁয়ের উঁচু ঢালের দিকে যে রাস্তাটা চলে গেছে, ওখানে গিয়ে একটা জায়গায় খুব ভালো রকম পানি ফেলে কাদা কাদা করে রাখলো। যাতে কেউ এদিক দিয়ে গেলেই পা পিছলে পড়ে। শয়তানি কম জানতো না রাখাল। দুয়ে দুয়ে চার মিলে গেল এক্কেবারে। এই পথ দিয়ে যখনই গাঁয়ের গোয়ালা দুধ নিয়ে যাচ্ছিল, রাখালের তৈরি করে রাখা ওই কাদামাখা গর্তে পা হড়কে গেল। দুধের পাত্র ভেঙে চৌচির। ওদিকে গোয়ালার চোখ ফাঁকি দিয়ে রাখাল তার দুধের পাত্র ভরে নিলো। তারপর ‘তাইরে নাইরে না’ গেয়ে বাড়ি গেল, মায়ের কাছে দুধ জমা দিয়ে ঠিক একইরকম শয়তানি করে চিনি নিয়ে এলো। মাও খুব খুশি। ছেলে তার একেবারে লায়েক হয়েছে। কী সুন্দর সব জিনিস যোগাড় করে আনলো, এবারে খুব ভালোমতো পিঠা বানিয়ে দেয়া চাই।

পিঠা সব রাখাল একাই সাবাড় করলো। খালি একটি বড় পিঠা সে সরিয়ে রাখলো। কিছুক্ষণ জিরিয়ে নিয়ে মাঠের একখানে ভালো করে খুঁড়ে, সেই পিঠাখানা পুঁতে দিলো। কিছুদিন যেতে না যেতেই সেই পিঠা থেকে চারা গজালো, পিঠার মস্ত বড় গাছ হলো। গাছের প্রতি ডালে ডালে আমের মতোই ঝুলে আছে সরেস একেকটা গরম গরম পিঠা। ব্যস, সারা জীবনের জন্য রাখালের আর পিঠা খাওয়ার চিন্তা নেই। এই ভেবে খুশিতে বাক বাকুম হয়ে যখন গাছের নিচে পা দোলাচ্ছে, তখনই সেখানে উদয় হলো এক থুত্থুরে বুড়ি। বুড়ি আসলে ডাইনি ছিল। রাখাল সে কথা জানতো না।

“ও ছেলে, আমাকে একটা পিঠা দাও না\!”

রাখালের কাছে এখন অনেক পিঠা। তাই আর কিপ্টেমি করলো না।

“তা বুড়িমা, পিঠা তো দিব– কিন্তু নেবে কীসে করে?”

“এই যে, আমার হাতে দাও।”

“কিন্তু পিঠা যে বড় গরম। তোমার হাত পুড়ে যাবে।”

“তাহলে এই যে, এই আমার মুখে পুরে দাও।”

“আহা বুড়িমা, তুমি কিচ্ছু বোঝো না\! পিঠা যে গরম। তোমার মুখ পুড়ে যাবে।”

তখন বুড়ি আস্তে করে একটা বড় থলে বের করে বললো, “বাবা, তাহলে এই থলেতে ভরে দাও পিঠাখানা। আহা কী সুন্দর গন্ধ\! কতদিন একটা পিঠা খাই না।”

বুড়ির মিষ্টি কথা শুনে রাখাল যে-ই না একটা পিঠা পেড়েছে, থলেতে ভরতে যাবে এমন সময় বুড়ি কপাত করে তার ঘাড়খানা ধরে থলেতে পুরে ফেললো আস্ত রাখালকেই। রাখাল কিছু বোঝার আগেই কম্মো সাবাড়। এরপর ডাইনি বুড়ি মনের সুখে বনের পথে গান ধরলো বিকট সুরে–

“হাঁউ মাঁউ কাঁউ– বলি, শুনছো নাকি কেউ? একটা মানুষ যদি পাও, ওমনি ধরে গাপুস গুপুস, আজকে হবে হাপুস হুপুস\!”

এমনি গান গাইতে গাইতে বুড়ির বড় তেষ্টা পেয়ে গেল। ডাইনি হলে কী হবে, আগের দিন আর নেই। বড় জলদি হাঁপিয়ে যায়। থলেটাকে তাই এক গাছের নিচে রেখে বুড়ি গেল পানি খেতে। এই সময়েই বনের পথ ধরে একদল রাখাল যাচ্ছিল। বুড়ির থলেটা দেখে ভালো কিছু পাবে ভেবে যেই না তারা থলের মুখ খুলেছে, ওমনি দেখে এ যে তাদেরই বন্ধু। তক্ষুনি বন্ধুকে উদ্ধার করে নিয়ে গেল রাখালের দল। আর বুড়ির থলেতে ভালো করে পুরে দিয়ে গেল কংকর, নুড়ি পাথর, কাঠের টুকরা এমন সব আবর্জনা। বুড়ি তো বাড়ি গিয়ে সবাইকে বললো,

“আজ তাগড়া একটা মানুষ ধরে এনেছি। রাতের খাবারটা যা জমে যাবে না\!”

কিন্তু কই, থলের ভেতর তো শুধু নুড়ি পাথর আর কংকর। ডাইনি বুড়ি খুব খেপে গেল। যে করেই রাখালটাকে শায়েস্তা করতে হবে। পরের দিন সে আবার গেল সেই পিঠা গাছের কাছে। রাখালকে ভুলিয়ে ভালিয়ে রাজিও করিয়ে ফেললো পিঠা দেয়ার জন্য। কিন্তু বুড়ি কি আর সত্যি পিঠা খেতে চায়? তার নজর তো রাখালের দিকে। যেই না রাখাল পিঠা থলেতে ভরে দেবে, বুড়ি আবারো ঘাড় ধরে হিড়হিড় করে তাকে থলেতে ঢুকিয়ে ফেললো। রাখাল ভাবলো, এইবার আর নিস্তার নেই।

সেই থলে বাড়িতে নিয়ে বুড়ি তার ছেলেবৌকে বললো, “আমরা সবাই বাড়ি ফেরার আগেই ভালো করে ধুয়ে-কেটে রান্না করে রাখবে। এসেই যেন খাবার পাই।” রাখার থলেতে বসে সব কথা শুনলো। আর মনে মনে ফন্দি আঁটলো। যেই না ডাইনির ছেলেবৌ ছোট ডাইনি থলেটা খুলেছে, ওমনি রাখাল বললো– “ছি, ছি তোমার দাঁত কী বিচ্ছিরি\! এমন দাঁত দেখে তোমার বর পালিয়ে যাবে।” ছোট ডাইনিটা ছিল খুবই বোকাসোকা। অমনি সে নিজের দাঁত ঢেকে বললো, “তোমার মতো অত সুন্দর সাদা ঝকঝকে দাঁত হবে কেমন করে? বলে দাও না ভাই।” রাখাল তখন বললো, এ আর এমন কী\! এক্ষুনি এক কড়া তেল গরম করতে দাও আর একটা চোঙা নিয়ে আসো।

এরপর চুলায় তেল গরম হতে থাকলো, আর রাখার তার পরের পাঁয়তারা ভাবতে থাকলো। তেল যখন একেবারে টগবগ করে ফুটে উঠেছে, রাখাল তখন ভুলভাল বুঝিয়ে ছোট ডাইনির মুখে চোঙা দিয়ে সবখানা তেল ঢেলে দিলো। সেই গরম তেলে ছোট ডাইনি জ্বলেপুড়ে গেল। তারপর তাকে ধুয়েটুয়ে, ভালোমতো রান্না করে তার সব গয়না-কাপড় পরে রাখাল বড় ডাইনির অপেক্ষা করতে লাগলো। রাত্তিরে যখন সবাই খেতে বসলো, তখন সবাইকে তাদের ঘরের বৌয়ের মাংসই খাইয়ে দিল। কেউ বুঝলোও না। সবাই ভাবলো, এ সেই পাজির পা ঝাড়া রাখাল ছেলের মাংস।

খাওয়া শেষে ছোট ডাইনির ছদ্মবেশে রাখাল বালক আর ডাইনি বুড়ি মিলে গেল নদীর ধারে হাত ধুতে। হাত ধোয়া শেষ হতে না হতেই রাখাল ঝাঁপ দিয়ে নদীতে পড়ে গেল। ডাইনি বুড়ির চক্ষু চড়কগাছ\!

“ও বৌ, যাসনে। নদীতে কুমির আছে। যাসনে।”

রাখাল তখন মুখ ঘুরিয়ে বললো, “হতচ্ছাড়ি বুড়ি, কে তোর বৌ\! দেখগে পেটের মাঝে, কী আছে\!”

এই বলে রাখাল এমন জোরে সাঁতার কেটে বাড়ি চলে গেল, কুমিররাও আর তার খবর পেলো না। আর সে ডাইনি, এমন জব্দ হলো যে আর ভুলেও কোনোদিন পিঠা গাছের আশপাশ দিয়ে যায়নি।

# **The stolen wife**

In a village, there lived a Brahmin and a Kayastha. Their houses were next to each other, and they shared a deep friendship. The Brahmin’s household was in a state of constant struggle, living hand to mouth. The Kayastha’s household did not suffer as much from a lack of basic necessities like rice and lentils, but his situation was not much better either. Neither of them was married.

One day, the Brahmin friend said, “How long can we go on like this? I’m thinking of getting married. But who would marry their daughter to me if things don’t improve? Will this poverty ever end?” The Kayastha friend echoed his thoughts, saying, “Exactly what I keep thinking. No one in this village will give their daughter to us\! We'll have to come up with another plan, you see. Let's go to another village and see if we can manage something there." At first, the Brahmin was reluctant, but eventually, he agreed to his friend's suggestion. The Kayastha said, "You don’t have to think too much. Just do as I say."

Following the almanac, the two friends set out on an auspicious day, heading to a distant village in search of brides. After walking all day and growing tired, they finally arrived at a new settlement. While resting under a banyan tree by a large pond, they saw several girls coming to fetch water. Among them, one girl particularly caught the Brahmin's eye.

The Kayastha friend, upon hearing about the Brahmin's interest, went to a nearby shop to gather information. The shopkeeper was a notorious chatterbox; if you asked one question, he'd tell you ten stories. But this habit proved useful as the shopkeeper, while veering off-topic, inadvertently provided some key details. From him, the Kayastha learned that:

“The girl is the daughter of Ramesh Chakraborty. A truly unfortunate soul, my dear. Her groom married her and left, never to be seen again. Not even her family has laid eyes on the groom since the wedding. I've heard he's settled elsewhere in Raniganj with another family. That’s why I say, the poor girl has a lot of bad luck\!”

The Kayastha friend, being quite shrewd, thought of gathering more information from the shopkeeper.

“So, can we find out anything about this groom? We're planning to pass through Raniganj anyway, might as well inquire a bit.”

“Oh, my dear, I could tell right away that you gentlemen are well-bred. The son-in-law of Chakraborty's daughter is named Ramlochan Mukherjee. I've heard he works as a clerk in a big boss’s office.”

Listening to all this information and after taking a puff from the shopkeeper's hookah, the two friends set off for the Chakraborti house. The Kayastha friend, with his sly intelligence, planned for the Brahmin to pose as Ramlochan, the groom, while he would act as his servant. They quickly concocted a convincing story to explain why the groom had been away for so long.

“Hey, Mr. Chakraborti, are you home?”

“Who’s there, brothers?”

“Oh my, it’s your son-in-law\! Don’t tell me you don’t recognize him\!”

The supposed son-in-law was treated with great care and affection at the girl's house. However, the bride herself became suspicious and couldn't fully trust them. Still, she remained quiet, holding back her doubts out of respect for her parents, but she couldn't stop her tears from flowing. Meanwhile, after enjoying the hospitality at their fake in-laws' house for several days, the two friends began considering returning home. 

A palanquin arrived outside, accompanied by four bearers. They took the bride in the palanquin, and halfway through the journey, the Kayastha friend said, "You must find a bride for me first. Only then will you start your married life. Remember, you need to get me a wife as good as yours." From behind the palanquin's curtain, the Brahmin's bride heard everything. Her suspicions became even stronger, realizing that neither of the two men had revealed their true identities.

The two friends devised a plan and sent the palanquin bearers back with the empty palanquin. Then, the Brahmin took his new bride home. Seeing the new bride, the Brahmin's mother, and the entire neighborhood were filled with joy and celebration. The fact that the stolen bride accepted them so easily made the two friends completely relaxed and elated, enjoying the moment to the fullest.

But the bride had her own plans. A few days later, as everyone was showering her with praises, calling her well-behaved and capable, the Kayastha friend arrived and said, “Now let’s go find my bride.” The Brahmin immediately agreed, as he had promised his friend to help find a bride, and he was also finding it difficult to spend quality time with his own new wife due to this promise. Without consulting any almanac, the Brahmin handed over all household responsibilities to his bride and set off, saying, “So be it, let’s go\!”

Meanwhile, as soon as the two friends left, the Brahmin's wife gathered all the valuables from the house and the money received as wedding gifts, wrapped them in her sari, and set the house on fire. The old Brahmin's mother perished in the flames, and the bride didn’t even look back.

Meanwhile, the two friends returned to their village, only to find that there was no trace of the house or the new Brahmin's wife. Seeing the disaster, the Kayasth friend, shaking his head, said:

“I will not resort to such deceitful paths again. 

Otherwise, my own house might turn to ashes too\!”

And the villagers, lamenting, said, “Oh, what a beautiful bride and a good mother-in-law—both have gone to heaven\!” But in reality, they had not gone to heaven. The bride had fled to her parental home. Even there, she did not reveal the truth. She concocted a story that her mother-in-law had died, so her groom had not come along. She stayed there for a few days, and her parents, being gullible, believed everything she said.

Meanwhile, after performing his mother’s shraddh, the Brahmin decided to visit his bride’s parental home. Oh, when he went there, he saw a different scene altogether. His bride was happily roaming around. Fortunately, she hadn’t disclosed anything to her parents. The Brahmin thought he would try his luck once more and see if fortune might change.

The bride was no less cunning. Having once tricked the Brahmin, she now planned to exact an even harsher punishment on his son. She had procured datura poison from the village witch and planned to mix it into a bowl of milk to poison him as soon as the Brahmin returned home.

As planned, the bride mixed the poison into the bowl of milk. That night, the Brahmin returned to his false wife, hoping to somehow win her back. Having not eaten all day and exhausted from the journey, he was ravenous. Seeing the bowl of milk, he drank it eagerly in one gulp. Shortly after, the poison took effect, and the Brahmin's body turned blue as he succumbed to the deadly toxin.

The Brahmin's wife, having disguised herself in a vibrant red silk sari, wrapped the body in old sarees and made her way to the jungle's edge, where the cremation ground was. However, as soon as she ventured into the forest with the corpse, a fierce storm began to brew. Lightning flashed intermittently, and the sound of crickets intensified. The dark clouds in the sky roared, and the bride found herself trapped in the cremation ground amidst the chaotic storm.

The band of robbers, seeing the Brahmin's wife amidst the dim light of the stormy night beside the cremation ground, thought they were witnessing the goddess Kali herself. They all joined their hands in reverence and vowed to offer golden tongues in her honor. The Brahmin's wife, bewildered and desperate, could hardly comprehend the situation unfolding around her.

Taking advantage of the situation, she looked at the leader of the robbers and said, “I am pleased with you. Here, receive your reward\!” Saying this, she threw the bundle containing her husband’s corpse, disguised as Kali, towards them.

Afterwards, the bride swiftly fled on the wind and returned to her father's house. When her family inquired about her husband, she replied that he had gone abroad in search of work and had told her to stay here.

From then on, no one ever troubled the Brahmin's daughter again. Even the real groom, Ramlochan, was never heard from. As for the Brahmin's friend, the Kaysht, he still occasionally searches for his Brahmin friend, wondering what might become of him if he mistakenly ends up at the Chokkottibari.

# **Byangoma and the prince**

King Bhimsen's capital was situated in the western part of Villri. The king was just and fair. Many knowledgeable scholars and Brahmins would visit his court. In that kingdom, there were people of all professions—shepherds, gardeners, oil pressers, blacksmiths, farmers, and even wanderers. Except for the very poor, everyone had homes, and people were generally well-off.

In such a prosperous kingdom lived a young bird hunter. Although he hunted birds, he never killed them. Every morning, he would go to the forest with his net to catch birds. He would capture the wild birds, place them in the net, and carry them to the market. Whatever he earned from selling them was enough for him to eat and live.

He would catch various birds from the wetlands, including the swan and the teal. He captured river eagles, kingfishers, black-necked storks, and even owls from the hollows of trees. He caught parakeets, red-throated finches, and flocks of sparrows. Occasionally, his net would even trap hornbills, along with other birds like waterfowl and cormorants.

One morning, as usual, the hunter set out with his net and cage. At that very moment, the holy Sufi Fakir in Mecca was asked about the state of worship. The Fakir replied, 

“O seeker, there is a hunter who goes to the forest every day to catch birds. You should meet him and guide him to the Bengma bird. The prayers from that bird's mouth will spread your devotion across the world.”

As per the Fakir's advice, the holy Sufi disguised himself as a Brahmin, donned a sacred thread and a white dhoti, wore wooden sandals, and carried an umbrella in one hand and a calendar in the other. He stood right in the middle of the hunter's path and said, "Come, hunter, listen to the calendar."

The hunter replied, "Forgive me. I don’t have a penny to spare. I cannot listen to the calendar right now."

Satyapir did not stop. He began reading the almanac:

"Today is Wednesday, the third day of the solar eclipse, which is auspicious for trade. O young hunter, today you will find success in the Sundarbans. You will catch many wild birds in the forest. But listen carefully to what I say: Deep in the forest, in a crack of an Ashoka tree, lives a pair of Bengma and Bengmi birds. If you can catch these birds, all your troubles will be resolved." 

Hearing this, the hunter ventured deep into the forest and spread his net near the Ashoka tree.

He covered his body with branches and grass to avoid detection, but he could not escape the keen eyes of the Bengma and Bengmi. The female Bengmi said, “Listen, the forest seems to be moving—an ominous sign. There shouldn't be so many leaves, no flowers, and the branches are swaying strangely. We have been in this forest for a long time, but it seems we need to move to another place. Let's go to a different forest right away. The trees seem to be closing in on us. I've never seen anything like this before. If we stay here, we might lose our lives\!”

The male Bengma went to his mate, but he did not give much heed to her words. By then, thanks to the pious intervention, the hunter’s net had wrapped around the Bengma’s neck. The bird struggled on the ground, appearing as if it might die.

The Bengma said, “Hunter, why are you committing this cruelty? The same fate awaits you that you impose on these birds. Every animal or bird you kill or capture will eventually result in your own suffering. Your wife and children will not escape this punishment. Listen to me—worship Lord Krishna.”

Hearing the bird speak in human voice, the hunter cut the net and gently placed the Bengma on his shoulder, stroking its back. Meanwhile, the Bengmi perched on the tree, weeping. She said, “Hunter, you do not understand righteousness or unrighteousness. What you are doing—hunting these birds—is wrong and sinful. At least now, do the right thing: release my husband, and I will give you a small token of reward.”

The hunter asked, “Beautiful, kind bird, I will listen to you. But what will I gain from this?”

The Bengma then began to narrate the story of Krishna to the hunter.

"One morning, Krishna was playing with his friends at his foster father Nanda's house. Amidst the play, little Gopal took some earth in his hand and put it in his mouth. Another boy, witnessing this, ran to inform Yashoda. She rushed over, scolding Krishna in anger, 'Didn't I just give you milk and butter this morning? Why are you eating dirt?' Innocent Krishna replied, 'Stop, stop. I didn't eat any dirt, Mother. Look into my mouth and see for yourself.' When Yashoda looked inside his mouth, she saw the entire universe."

Hearing Krishna's story, the hunter began to cry, reflecting on his sins. He said, "From today, you are my teacher. By sharing Krishna's story, you have purified me. But I catch birds because it's my livelihood. Otherwise, what will I eat? What will I wear?"

Then Bengama gave the hunter three precious rubies strung around its neck. However, the poor hunter, unaware of the value of gems, said, "Did you just give me some wild fruit seeds?"

Bengama then told the hunter, “Take these to the royal court tomorrow. I promise, if you ever find yourself in trouble, just remember me. Bengamas always keep their word.” With this assurance, the hunter released Bengama and headed back home, discarding his hunting net along the way.

Meanwhile, the hunter’s wife was sitting at home, deeply worried. It had been seven days since they had any food in the house. Her husband had gone to the forest early in the morning, and if he had caught any animals or birds, he would surely have returned quickly. Just then, the hunter entered the house empty-handed. Seeing this, the hunter's wife burst into tears. The hunter comforted her and showed her the three rubies that Bengama had given him.

The wife examined the stones closely and said, “Are these really rubies? No, they must be some kind of fruit seeds.” Saying this, she tossed them aside. Two of the rubies fell inside the house, but one rolled outside. That night, they spent in frustration and sadness. When they both fell asleep, a guard was patrolling outside. He noticed the ruby gleaming in the moonlight and picked it up. Without wasting any time, he took the ruby and hurried back to his own house.

Satya Narayan knew everything that had happened. He sat by the sleeping hunter’s head and appeared in his dream, saying, “Wake up, wake up. How can you foolishly throw away the rubies out of anger? The bird gave you priceless gems. Why are you sleeping after discarding them? Take the remaining two rubies to the king\! Your days of suffering will end.”

In the morning, the hunter took the rubies and went to the royal court. He pleaded with the king, “Please give me some rice and some coins, and I will return to my cottage.” The king laughed in disbelief, “How many maunds of rice do you want in exchange for these?”

The hunter, not understanding much about such matters, asked for five maunds of rice. The king, knowing the true value of the rubies, easily gave him the five maunds of rice. The hunter and his wife were overjoyed.

That night, after dinner, the king sat on his bed and chewed on some betel leaves mixed with camphor. He then gifted the two rubies to the queen. The queen was overjoyed. She called her maids and instructed them to adorn her. They combed her hair, tied flowers into her bun, and applied kohl to her eyes. The queen looked stunning, like one of Indra's celestial nymphs. But one of her maids commented, “If there were one more piece of jewelry, your look would be complete.”

The maid said, "Tell the king to get another ruby. If the queen wears it on her forehead, her beauty will shine even brighter than a hundred moons."

When the king returned to the inner palace, the queen mentioned this to him. However, the king no longer had any more rubies. The queen began to cry and insisted that the king must somehow get another ruby for her.

To calm the queen, the king then summoned his ministers and asked for their advice. They suggested that they should bring the hunter and ask him to find another ruby. The king's messenger went and brought the hunter to the palace.

Hearing this, the poor hunter felt as if the sky had fallen on his head. Nonetheless, with hope in his heart, he said, “Very well, Your Majesty, I will go back to the place where I found the previous ones and get another.” He was then released.

The hunter returned to the forest and went to the same Ashoka tree. However, this time, as soon as the Bengma saw him, it flew away. The hunter sat at the base of the tree and began to weep, calling out, “You promised me. Please keep your promise, Bengma\!”

Then the Bengma descended and the hunter took it to the royal court.

“Your Majesty, this bird is the one that gave me the jewels.”

“Can you give me another jewel right now?” the Maharaja asked.

“Your Majesty, I have no wealth other than the name and stories of Krishna,” replied the Bengma.

“Then let us hear about Krishna from your lips\!”

Everyone listened in rapt attention as the Bengma described the birth of Krishna, the roles of Brahma and Narayana, and the story of the Govardhan Hill. Impressed by the Bengma’s account, the Maharaja decided to abandon the path of envy and embrace devotion. The Maharaja was very pleased with the Bengma’s advice and released the hunter. However, the Maharaja did not release the Bengma. He placed the Bengma in a golden cage, and both the king and queen made it a ritual to hear Krishna's stories from the Bengma twice a day.

Twelve years passed in this manner. One day, a horde of tigers attacked the kingdom. The Maharaja, leading an army of ninety thousand soldiers, set out to drive away the threat. Meanwhile, Prince Kamodara, captivated by the stories of Krishna from the Bengma, was enchanted.

The Bengma said, "Kamodara, I will now dance for you. Enjoy the performance." As the Bengma began to dance, spreading its feathers like a magnificent peacock, the prince was spellbound. The Bengma then said, "But dancing inside this cage is impossible. Release me, and I will show you my true performance."

Kamodara said, “But you will just fly away.”

The Bengma replied, “Why would I fly away? If you release me, I will be able to show you my dance properly.”

Not realizing the Bengma’s trick, Kamodara opened the cage. The Bengma flew out and danced for a while, spreading its wings. As the prince became distracted, the Bengma took off, laughing, and flew up to the top of the palace walls. Kamodara was left in despair, as if the sky had fallen on his head.

The Bengma, as it flew away, reassured Kamodara, “If the king tries to harm you, remember my words, and I will come to your aid. But after being imprisoned for twelve years, I cannot stay here any longer.”

With that, the Bengma flew away. At that very moment, the king returned from the forest and sent for the Bengma. Upon hearing that the bird had escaped, the king was furious. Kamodara was summoned immediately, and he knew there was no escape from the king’s wrath.

The bird had flown away, leaving the unfortunate prince in dire trouble. Kamodara, in tears, begged his father for mercy. However, the king showed no compassion, as the loss of the bird seemed to him a greater grievance than his son's plight. By the king's orders, the guards dragged Kamodara away. At this moment, Kamodara pleaded with the guards:

“Please, let me go to my mother just once. She can surely persuade my father to show mercy.”

Kamodara pleaded with his mother, but she harshly replied, “Why did you let the bird go? My words hold no weight against the king’s orders.” Heartbroken by his parents’ lack of compassion, Kamodara had no choice but to face his fate. The guards, following the king’s orders, took him to the forest.

Desperate to save his life, Kamodara made one last plea. He asked the guards to allow him to bathe in a nearby lake and pray to Krishna for his salvation before his death. The guard, being kinder than the king and queen, agreed to this request.

Kamodara, while bathing and performing the ritual with a few drops of Ganga water, remembered his parents, friends, and finally Bengma. His prayers reached the divine, and the Supreme Being, aware of Bengma’s promise being forgotten and the imminent danger to Kamodara, became displeased.

Saty Narayan, seeing the situation, scolded Bengma: “You fled and left Kamodara in peril. Now, because of you, Kamodara is about to be executed. I command you to go immediately and bring him back here on your back.”

Bengma immediately flew and carried Kamodara to safety. Upon seeing this, there was a wave of despair among the people. However, the king and queen remained indifferent as before. The citizens of the city began to weep bitterly for the prince.

Meanwhile, Bengma carried Kamodara high into the sky, seemingly approaching the heavens. Then, heading west, he flew deep into the forest. Upon reaching a dilapidated house, Bengma gently set Kamodara down and said, “Stay here until I return with food. Do not leave this place until then.”

Bengma replied reassuringly, “I won’t leave you in danger. I will return, so don’t worry. Just wait here, and stay safe.”

The bird reassured Kamodara and flew off in search of food. Nearby was another kingdom ruled by King Birbar. The bird entered the capital and, from a sweet shop, obtained some confectionery. On its way back, while flying over the royal palace, the bird saw the princess. Named Suryamoni, she was as beautiful as the sunrise. The bird thought to itself, “How can I arrange a marriage between this beautiful girl and Kamodara?”

After Kamodara had his fill, the bird told him about Suryamoni. Upon hearing this, Kamodara became restless. However, the palace was surrounded by magical barriers. How could they get inside?

After much thought, the bird devised a plan. Using its magical powers, it bypassed the enchantments and brought Kamodara right into the princess’s chamber. 

Kamodara did not touch the sleeping Suryamoni, fearing that he might wake her. Instead, he simply admired her beauty before returning that night.

Two days later, Kamodara again mounted the back of the bird and visited the princess's chamber. A lamp adorned with precious gems was burning by Suryamoni’s pillow. Once again, Kamodara did not wake her but spent the entire night admiring her beauty. He thought, "If I leave now, how will the princess ever know that Kamodara visited?" So, he draped his own cloak over the sleeping princess.

When Suryamoni awoke in the morning, she was astonished to find the blue cloak draped over her.

The next morning, the palace staff weighed the princess as was customary. To their surprise, her weight was double the usual amount. The attendants were astonished, but Suryamoni explained, “It is normal for a growing young woman’s weight to increase. You may go now.”

As night fell and Kamodara returned, he found the princess awake. Seeing him, Suryamoni became very angry. “Who are you? Whose son are you? Where is your land?” 

Kamodara then revealed his entire sad story to her. Hearing his plight, Suryamoni's anger softened, and her heart began to melt.

From then on, every night Kamodara would visit the princess, Suryamoni, riding on the back of Bengma. Thanks to the saint's miraculous powers, no one had a hint of what was happening.

One day, Suryamoni became pregnant. The news created a stir in the royal palace, but Suryamoni denied all accusations. The guards were given three days to find out who was visiting the princess.

In disguise as a Vaishnav saint, the guard thoroughly searched the city for two days without success. Finally, that night, the guard sprinkled vermilion powder around the princess's bedroom.

When Kamodara arrived that night, Suryamoni warned him and told him to leave. Kamodara obeyed her. However, as he entered, his clothes got stained with the vermilion. The next morning, Kamodara returned to the depths of the forest and took his stained clothes to a washerman to clean them.

Meanwhile, the clever guard went straight to the washerman's house, where Kamodara's clothes were left near the door. In the evening, when Kamodara came to collect his washed clothes, the guard, disguised as a washerman, seized him. 

Furious, the king ordered Kamodara to be executed. Suryamoni was devastated and wept bitterly, pressing her forehead in despair.

After reaching the lake's edge, Kamodara requested some time from the guards, citing the need to pray one last time before his execution. He then descended into the lake and called out to Bengma. The divine bird came to his aid, rescuing him and Suryamoni, and they all fled together.

With Bengma's help, they settled in a small, happy home in the forest. One day, Suryamoni expressed a strong desire to taste a special mango. Kamodara lamented, "I am just an ordinary man. How can I obtain such a fruit?" Hearing this, Bengma assured them, "I promise to bring this mango for you. Do not worry. I will cross seven seas and return from Lanka in twelve days. Stay here and be safe."

Bengma flew to Lanka Island and retrieved the special mangoes. He ate one himself and carried the other two on his return journey. However, during his voyage, he landed on the island of Chandan, and despite his promise, he did not return.

Days turned into weeks, and Suryamoni and Kamodara, desperately searching for any sign of Bengma, eventually reached Chandan Island. There, they discovered Bengma's lifeless body among the sandalwood trees, with the two mangoes he had brought for them lying beside him.

The grieving prince performed a ritual bath for Bengma's body in the Ganges and offered pindadan for Bengma's and his ancestors' souls.

After consuming the fruit Bengma had brought, Suryamoni gave birth to a healthy son after ten months and ten days. They named him Birbar, after Suryamoni's father.

The three of them then boarded a floating banana raft in the river. A Nepali rat, which was actually sent by the pīr, was drifting nearby. Despite Suryamoni's objections, Kamodara insisted on using the rat to carry the raft. The rat, not understanding the divine intervention, gnawed at the raft in such a way that it broke into three pieces, sending them in different directions.

Kamodara drifted to the northern lands and found work in a sugarcane plantation. Suryamoni reached a gardener’s estate and was welcomed into the home of the gardener’s wife. Their son was rescued and taken in by a merchant named Gangadhar, who treated him with great care and affection, much like Krishna was cared for by his foster father Nand.

Thus, five years passed, with the child growing up well under Gangadhar’s loving care.

Suryamoni, working day and night in the gardener’s house, one day saw her son with a beautiful housewife. Overwhelmed with emotion, she could only cry while reciting the name of Rama.

At that moment, the truth-pir appeared before her and told her to go to her child. He also informed her that Kamodara was in the city, staying at a laundress’s house.

Suryamoni then went to her son and revealed everything to him. The boy, filled with many questions, ran to the merchant and asked, “Father, tell me the truth, who are my real parents?”

The merchant realized it was time to tell the truth. With a heavy heart, he recounted the story of finding the boy by the river. The boy then wanted to go to his real mother. Understanding the merchant’s pain, the boy was comforted by hearing the stories of Krishna and Yashoda. Despite the sorrow, the merchant bade his son farewell with a heavy heart.

The boy told his birth mother, Suryamoni, “Let’s go find father now.”

Meanwhile, that morning, Lord Satyanarayana appeared in Kamodra's dream and instructed him to sit under a specific tree with sweets the next morning. He also mentioned that during a festival, Kamodra would be reunited with his wife and child.

At dawn, Kamodra followed the instructions from his dream. Meanwhile, his wife and son were traveling the same path. Eventually, they were reunited. Following Suryamoni’s advice, they set off towards Kamodra’s homeland. On their journey, they passed through the kingdoms of Raja Veerbahu, Krishna Ketu, Vishwajoy, and Veer Mahajeta.

Then preparations for the worship of Satya Pīr began. Learned priests and Brahmins arrived. The worship area was adorned with gold and betel leaves. Large quantities of sugar, flower garlands, milk, jaggery, and sweet bananas were brought in. A ceremonial dish, the \*shirni\*was prepared. Conch shells were blown, and drums and claps marked the celebration. The Brahmins chanted the Vedas, completing the ritual with great devotion.

# **Nimai Sanyas**

The early 15th century marked the beginning of Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign over Bengal. During his rule, the upper-caste Hindus lived in luxury and comfort, while the lower castes were neglected and marginalized. It was during this time that Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, known in his early life as ‘Nimai,’ made his appearance. Born in 1486, Nimai’s life left a profound impact on the religious landscape, and he passed away in 1533\. His death remains shrouded in mystery even today. Some believe that he disappeared on his own, while others suggest that he was murdered.

Nimai was quite renowned in his neighborhood. He ran a small school, or 'tol,' where he not only taught but also entertained the local boys with various stories beyond the usual lessons. His charismatic presence and engaging storytelling made his 'tol' a lively hub for learning and laughter.

At home, Nimai lived with his mother, Shachidevi, and his newly wedded wife, Vishnupriya. Before Vishnupriya, he was married to another sweet-natured girl named Lakshmipriya. Unfortunately, Lakshmipriya met a tragic end; she passed away after being bitten by a snake.

Nimai had an elder brother named Vishvarupa. Before Nimai could understand much, Vishvarupa left household life and became a monk. Since then, their mother Shachidevi has been very worried, fearing that the younger son might follow the same path\! But the neighbors always praised Nimai and told her, "Don't worry, Shachi. Nimai won't become a monk." Nimai thought the same way.

He joyfully runs his school and manages his household. His nature is very lively. He is on good terms with the washerman and the grocer at the general store. Even without a single coin in his pocket, everyone comes and gives him things. Everyone loves Nimai dearly.

Once, Nimai went to Gaya Dham to perform the ritual of offering for his deceased father. After returning, he was no longer the same. He would lose consciousness frequently, and looking into his eyes, it seemed like nothing in the world interested him anymore. Even his beautiful wife Vishnupriya—if she said ten things, Nimai would only listen to one.

Mother Shachidevi noticed everything. Could it be that her fears were about to come true? She went to her friend Malini, crying, and said, “Nimai isn’t like before, my friend. Since returning from Gaya, he seems different.” Malini dismissed her concerns, saying, “What change in Nimai? He’s always smiling. People say Nimai doesn’t walk on the road—he practically flies\! He’s such a spirited boy\!”

But a mother’s heart senses everything. Now, Nimai’s face and eyes are filled only with Krishna’s name. The real story, however, is known to no one else. Only Nimai knows. And his guru is from Gaya—his name is Ishwar Puri. When Nimai went to Gaya, he met him there. It was there that he received the mantra, but upon returning home, he told no one.

One day, Nimai woke up and started crying incessantly, then laughing at moments. Seeing his behavior, everyone thought Nimai had gone mad. Ignoring everyone else, Nimai said to his mother, "Someone appeared to me in my dream, Mother\! A dark-complexioned youth, whose black hue seemed to illuminate the entire world."

"He looked at me in such a way, Mother, that it felt like his eyes were not just eyes—they were two lotus flowers blooming in a pond\! I must go to that youth, Mother. Don't stop me anymore." 

A few days passed like this. Then one day, Nimai left home. Where he went after leaving, only a few of his close companions knew, but no one else did.

The people of the neighborhood murmured, "Nimai Pandit of Nabadwip has taken sannyas\!" Shachi Maa sat with her head in her hands. No one saw when the kajal on Vishnupriya’s eyes was smeared by her tears. Nimai did return once, but only to bid farewell to his mother and wife.

Wearing a torn blanket, Nimai roams the streets. Whenever someone comes to beat him, he stretches out his arms and says, "Beat me\!" His calm and gentle demeanor combined with this peculiar behavior stirs thoughts in people’s minds. They, too, start following Nimai, enchanted by some magical charm.

Nimai wins everyone over with talks of devotion, love, and compassion. His speech is filled with Krishna’s name, and he becomes ecstatic with every mention of it. Whenever he regains his senses, he resumes chanting Krishna’s name. One day, his friend Gadadhar came and scolded him severely, urging him to return home.

Nimai asked only one question, "Friend, can you tell me, where does Krishna reside?" Gadadhar then comforted him, saying, "Oh, Krishna resides in your heart—don't you know?" Hearing this, the mad Nimai tried to cut open his chest. Such was his behavior. Years passed, and Nimai, now known as Sri Chaitanya, began his work of spreading religion in Navadvipa.

In Navadvipa, there lived two other brothers, Jagannath and Madhai. Together, they were known as Jagai-Madhai. Although their names had religious connotations, the two brothers were notorious rascals. One day, they would throw stones at someone's house, and the next, they would raid another's home. Being notorious drunkards, these brothers were responsible for maintaining order in the city. Far from being protectors, they were more like predators. No one liked them due to their rowdiness and thuggery, and many avoided them out of fear.

A close associate of Sri Chaitanya was Nityananda. One day, he noticed the names of Jagai and Madhai. He thought, if even such wicked people could be brought to the path of religion, what could be greater? Nityananda went to the two brothers and said, "Brothers, chant the holy name of Hari. The name of Hari is very sweet." Jagai and Madhai became very angry and came charging at Nityananda to beat him.

The next day, Jagai and Madhai encountered Nityananda again. This time, they were drunk in broad daylight. Blocking Nityananda's path, they said, "Who are you? Do you have a fancy for chanting the holy name?" Nityananda, smiling, replied, "Brothers, give up poison and partake in the nectar." In a fit of rage, Madhai threw a shard of a broken pot lying nearby.

Immediately, his head was split open, and blood began to flow profusely. Hearing the news, Sri Chaitanya rushed over. Seeing his devotee in such distress, he lost his composure. In a fit of rage, he shouted, "Wretched\! How dare you, being a Brahmin's son, do this? If you harm a devotee, even God does not spare you from punishment\!"

Saying this, with a thunderous roar, he declared, "Sudarsana, Sudarsana\!" Immediately, from somewhere, a fearsome and blazing ball of fire, Vishnu's Sudarsana Chakra, came rushing. Nityananda realized that he had to appease the Lord's anger, or else there would be chaos.

He quickly came forward, holding the weapon in his hands, and said, "What are you doing, Lord? You had promised not to wield the discus in the Kali Yuga. You must keep your word. Please withdraw the Sudarsana Chakra and forgive these two fools." Hearing these words from his devotee, Sri Chaitanya calmed down.

Seeing everything, Jagai and Madhai fell silent. They approached Nityananda and Mahaprabhu with folded hands. From then on, they both engaged in chanting the holy names of Hari, traveling from village to village. Inspired by their example, even the local drunks and ruffians turned to the path of dharma.

In the holy abode of Navadvipa, the Lord was born,

In Katwa, the Lord's sacred place you must surely know.

The birthplace of Ekachakra and residence in Khardaha,

And Nityananda's two sacred abodes, know them well.

# **The Chronicles of Dulal**

 [The Chronicles of Dulal (otibeguni.com)](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/the-chronicles-of-dulal)

In a certain country, there lived a merchant named Alal Saudagar. He lived happily with his beautiful wife and son, Dulal. As Dulal grew older, when he turned twelve, he insisted on going hunting in the deep forest. His parents couldn’t refuse their only son, even though they had a bad feeling about it. Despite their worries, they allowed Dulal to venture into the woods. Once in the forest, he lost his way and couldn't find the path back home. Wandering aimlessly, Dulal became a drifter, as if the magic of the forest made him forget about returning to his parents.

On the other hand, Rupa Sundari's beauty seemed to fade day by day with worry for her son. Alal Saudagar's trading ship sank, yet Dulal did not return home. How could he? He had lost his way and ended up in a completely different land.

In that new land, Dulal met the king, Salim Badshah. The king asked him, "Boy, where is your home?" Dulal, unable to recall much about his home, simply replied, "In an unknown city." Seeing the boy’s carefree nature, the king felt pity for him and decided to keep him close. Dulal roamed freely and lived comfortably, with no memory of his past life.

In the meantime, Dulal had grown strong and robust. One day, he thought to himself, "How long will I continue to live idly, doing nothing? What will people say? It's time I find some work." Even though he had little interest in work, these thoughts led him to approach the king. Dulal asked for a task, and the king readily handed him the keys to the royal granary, instructing him to manage it carefully. At the end of the year, the king would expect an account of the granary from Dulal.

Though Dulal had taken on the responsibility of managing the granary, keeping track of it was not his forte. He ate some of the supplies, let some go to waste, and invited anyone he came across to help themselves to the granary. In just a few days, the royal granary was in utter disarray due to Dulal's negligence.

Meanwhile, Dulal's parents, Alal Saudagar and Rup Sundari, were frantically searching for him across distant lands. They had handed over all their wealth to the caretaker and now wandered as beggars. One day, by a stroke of fate, they arrived at the gates of King Salim's palace, disguised as a poor couple. But alas, misfortune struck—Dulal, now absorbed in his duties at the royal granary and blinded by the luxuries of palace life, failed to recognize his own parents.

Dulal didn’t even glance at them, and in their sorrow, the merchant and Rup Sundari passed away that very day. That night, Dulal dreamt of the moon and sun falling from the sky and crashing to the ground. Though he couldn’t make sense of the dream, it left him deeply unsettled. His restless heart became even more troubled. Without telling anyone, he took the king’s horse from the stable and set off into the unknown in the dead of night.

No one had a clue that Dulal had left the kingdom. By then, he had wandered into a new, unknown realm. Deep within a forest of that land, he tied his horse under a tree and lay down to sleep. Suddenly, a bear woke him up and said,

"The one who’s come here—food for the enchantress’s feast.  

What will this lost traveler do? By tomorrow, he'll be her beast\!"

Dulal paid no attention to the bear and lay down again, undisturbed. The bear, though kind-hearted and harmless, neither ate anyone nor caused fear. Its sole purpose was to warn forest dwellers of the dangers posed by enchantresses. But when Dulal ignored its warning, the bear simply went back home, baffled. It had never encountered such a stubborn boy before\!

The night passed like this. As soon as Dulal ventured out of the jungle the next day, an enchantress caught him in her spell. No matter which way Dulal turned, he always ended up in the same spot. He had no objections to falling under her control. When the enchantress asked him to marry her, Dulal happily agreed. She performed magic while Dulal watched in awe. Fascinated by her powers, he too wanted to learn magic. One by one, his new bride taught him every spell. Dulal had never met anyone as intriguing as her.

Dulal mastered all sorts of magic—tree magic, fish magic, and more—until everything was within his grasp. After a while, they had a son, but the child of a human and an enchantress faced challenges. Soon, the boy passed away, and Dulal's heart shattered. He informed his wife that he could no longer stay there and decided to leave for a new land. However, his wife was no ordinary woman; she was a renowned enchantress. She would not let him go so easily, especially since Dulal was her own disciple.

For quite some time, a peculiar magical battle ensued between them. The wife cast her spells, but Dulal quickly countered them. Suddenly, the enchantress transformed into a massive banyan tree. Dulal, however, remained unfazed and continued on his path, undeterred by any obstacles in his way.

In this new land, Dulal heard the sounds of drums and festivities all around him. He asked the people and learned that the king’s palace was in need of soldiers\! Seizing the opportunity, Dulal took the job. To bond with another soldier, he asked, "Brother, is there a wedding at the king's palace?" The soldier replied, "Oh, brother, there’s a wedding every day\! The king's daughter needs a new groom daily. No one knows where the old grooms go\!"

Hearing this, Dulal wondered what the mystery meant. That night, he couldn't sleep. He kept watch outside the princess's room. Eventually, he saw a mad ascetic taking the new groom away. Dulal followed him and saw the ascetic performing some rituals while seated with the king's groom. Looking around, the ascetic gobbled up the groom\! Dulal's eyes widened in shock. This wasn’t an ascetic; it was a demon\! Today, he had taken the princess as well\!

Today, he felt particularly hungry. He also had to keep an eye on the new soldier—he was quite plump\! Just then, Dulal stepped forward and said, “Ascetic, please show me how to perform the worship\!” “What a surprise\!” thought the ascetic, “He has come to me himself. Let me show him the rituals.” As soon as the demon in ascetic guise lowered his head, Dulal swiftly severed it with his sword. He turned to the princess and said, “Don’t be afraid. I am Dulal the soldier, roaming the roads.”

Hearing the commotion, the king and everyone from the royal palace rushed there. Finally, it became clear where the king's sons-in-law had been disappearing every night\! Both the king and the princess were very pleased with Dulal's cleverness. Dulal became the king’s new son-in-law. But who knew how long he would be satisfied with this new role, given his restless nature? Perhaps soon he would embark on another adventure. However, for quite some time, there was no news about Dulal; it was said he had settled down and was living a comfortable family life.

# **Malonchomala**

[Malonchomala (otibeguni.com)](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/malonchomala)

There was a king named Chandra. Like all the other sorrowful kings in fairy tales, he had the same old sorrow. He had plenty of kingdom, subjects, and wealth, but he lacked only one thing: a child to brighten his home. In his yearning for a child, the king organized a grand yajna. He fasted for three days and three nights and received the fruits of the yajna. It was decreed in the yajna that the king must break his fast by eating the two fruits that would be found together on the same mango tree in the royal garden.

"Under the tender leaves, the golden fruits glisten,  

Two fruits—attached by a single stem."

The king commanded, "You must pick the two fruits while keeping them on the stem. If you succeed, you'll earn the king's shawl; otherwise, you'll face punishment\!" Hearing this, no one else dared, but the palace servant stepped forward. He muttered five incantations and, shouting "Hēiyō," hurled a massive stone at the mangoes. Through the power of the spell, he succeeded. Everyone exclaimed,

"Oh, the might of the mantra\!  

The king has received the fruits,  

And the servant—he gains the king's shawl\!"

Everything was going well until trouble arose on the way from the garden to the palace. Once on the winged horse, the king tore off the stems and arranged the two mangoes. But fruits placed on a horse’s back can easily get swapped. No one noticed. Meanwhile, the queen was waiting in the palace, ready to eat the yagna's fruits. The king hurriedly handed her the fruit from the right side and took the one from the left for himself. The yagna’s instructions were thus violated, but no one realized it.

In this way, ten months and ten days passed. A prince was born to the king and queen, shining like a full moon in their home. Outside the birthing chamber, the maid Malini kept watch, telling tales of the kingdom to lull the queen to sleep. With the magic of the sleep-inducing aunts and relatives, everyone soon fell asleep. It was at this moment that the deities of fortune came to assess the fate of the prince.

But when they arrived, they saw that fate had turned against them\! Due to the flaws on both sides, the lifespan of the prince had been reduced. It was written on his royal forehead that he would live only for twelve days. The deities were deeply saddened, but what could they do? As they prepared to leave, they accidentally bumped into Malini’s toes. Malini was the king and queen's most trusted servant, and she loved the prince more than her own life.

She insisted that the deities must reveal the prince's fate\! The deities replied that all light had gone out of the kingdom. The king and queen became like stone in their grief. The elephant in the elephant stable ran away, and the horses in the horse stable died. Even the winged horse forgot to eat or drink. Seeing such sorrow among the people of the kingdom, the gates of heaven trembled. Seven days passed, and only five days remained for the prince's life.

On such a day of deep sorrow, an astrologer Brahmin arrived at the royal gate. After hearing everything, he proposed a solution. He said, if it is to be beneficial, then:

“A seven-day vow will be taken, and the bride will be twelve years old. 

If the prince marries in this manner, then the fate's curse will be broken.”

Hearing this, a rush spread throughout the kingdom as they searched far and wide for a twelve-year-old princess. Yet, they found no princess. Instead, they discovered the daughter of the Kotala, who had been the one to pluck the mangoes. Her name was Malonchoomala. She wore anklets that jingled like bees, and flowers bloomed wherever she walked. With arms like swan necks, hair like flowing waves, a nose like a flute, and a complexion of gold, she was truly a golden idol. The moon itself would feel ashamed in her presence, and she was destined to be the bride of Prince Chandramanik.

Three truths were asked, and Malonchoomala became the queen of the royal house. However, fate had written a different story, and the prince’s life slipped away in the wedding chamber. In a fit of rage and sorrow, the king sought vengeance on the Kotala. Meanwhile, the newly widowed Malonchoomala faced a cruel fate: her head was shaved, she was covered in mud, and her eyes were gouged out as punishment.

All the punishments endured, Malonchoomala took her infant husband to the center of the funeral pyre, asking the king for a boon. The rain drenched the pyre, and spirits and ghosts came, yet none dared approach her. She sat resolutely with her child in her lap. The demons and old women of the cremation ground begged, “Oh Malonchoo, don’t give him to us\! Let us feast in peace.” But she ignored their pleas, remaining steadfast. Even the messengers of death, Kaladut and Shaladut, circled from afar, unable to sway her resolve.

Quite some time passed, with no sense of time. Suddenly, a beautiful girl resembling Malonchomala appeared, laughing as she approached. She tossed her hair aside and called out, “Oh Malonchoo, you are my dear friend\! With the medicinal herbs of the forest, I can bring your husband back to life.”

There, she encounters a tiger. The tiger, as tigers do, lunges forward with a growl, intent on devouring the child. But Malonchomala isn’t one to back down easily. Having just returned her husband from death, she refuses to let him fall into the tiger's claws. She boldly says, “Look, tiger. This is my husband. Eating him won't satisfy your hunger. Why don’t you eat me instead?”

Hearing this, the tiger felt a pang of sadness. He took Malonchomala and ChandroMaanik to his home, where he lived happily with his tigress wife. Malonchomala affectionately called the tiger "uncle" and the tigress "aunt," and they cared for the two as if they were their own children. Thus, five years passed. One day, Malonchomala said, “Uncle and Aunt, it's time for me to say goodbye.”

With tears in their eyes, the tiger and tigress bid farewell to Malonchomala. She arrived at a desolate garden, with the creamy-white palace of a king in the southern direction. As soon as she stepped into the garden, it burst into life with buzzing bees, and flowers, vines, and leaves adorned the trees. The fragrance of the blossoms filled the air, and from within the house emerged the garden's caretaker, Malini. “Who are you, dear? Your touch has brought such fragrance to the garden\! Come in, come inside.”

From then on, they lived in Malini's house. Malonchomala didn't reveal her identity for fear of incurring the king's wrath again; this felt safer. Chandromani grew up and attended school, but Malonchomala stayed away, afraid that he might call her “Mother.” She cooked for him, and Malini would take the food to him, ensuring he was well-fed while keeping their secret safe.

Thus, seven years passed. In the land of the milky-white king, he had seven sons and one daughter named Kanchanmala. Chandromani attended the same school as the king’s children, and his talents were unmatched. The king's sons burned with jealousy upon seeing Chandromani's exceptional abilities. But Kanchanmala had different thoughts; she was almost infatuated with Chandromani's beauty and talents. She scribbled his name on paper and sang softly about him:

“In his hands, the moon shines bright,  

On his feet, the moon’s pure light,  

Countless moons rise and fall,  

Yet his face outshines them all.”

The final exams at the school concluded, and in the last race, Chandromani outpaced the king’s sons on his swift steed. But as the victory garland was about to be presented, an extraordinary event occurred. There sat Kanchanmala, the princess, atop the golden spire of the royal palace, weaving a fragrant garland with her own hands. She tossed the garland into the air, and it landed around Chandromani's neck. With the princess's garland draped upon him, the jealousy of the seven brothers bubbled beneath the surface, but they united to take him to the royal court.

But no one knew that he was the son of the king—not the son of Malini. The white king was furious. How could the princess adorn the son of a maid with a garland? This was an absolute calamity\! Having garlanded him, the marriage was deemed confirmed. After three days and nights of celebration, on the fourth day, Chandromani was shackled and sentenced to twelve years of punishment. They locked him away, banishing the son of the moon to the dungeons.

Meanwhile, Malonchomala hears all the news from the peacock. She rolls in the dust by the edge of her lake, and the moon in the sky completely hides behind clouds in her sorrow. It is said that in Bangladesh, on the fringes of Tangail-Savar, lies the lake imbued with the memory of a sorrowful maid's daughter, known as "Malonchomala's Dighi," a place steeped in the fragrance of fairy tales.

"Though he was destined to live only twelve days, today marks the completion of twelve years. In the house of the fair king, Chandramanik will receive a royal bride. Princess Kanchanomala, most beautiful of all, shall be his wife, thus lifting the shadow of misfortune."

Malancho, having handed the letter to the bird, sat down and wept. However, she had yet to hear the real news. She believed her husband was happily living with the princess. But neither she nor the bird knew about the imprisonment. With a heavy heart, Malancho decided to return to her parental home. She thought to herself:

"In the sea where I found a gem, in that land where I lost my father—  

In the waters of that sea, my heartache shall be washed away."

The road ahead was filled with thorns and sharp stones. As Malonchomala traveled, she encountered her tiger uncle and aunt in the forest. The tiger, knowing all the news of that land, informed Malonchomala, "A garland around the neck? If the prince of the kingdom marries into the house of a gardener, then that groom must wear chains for twelve years. This is the law of this land."

Upon hearing everything, Malonchomala realized that it was up to her to save Chandramanik. With this thought, she made her way to the ivory-hued king’s prison, where the prince was imprisoned for twelve long years. Around his neck was not the wedding garland, but a strong iron chain. Malonchomala spent day and night there, trying to bite through the iron shackles with her teeth. It seemed impossible—but in fairy tales, anything can happen.

"One watch, eight teeth lost—one layer of the shackle was cut.  

Four watches passed, and four layers of chains were undone."

When Chandramanik awoke, he found himself free. He hadn't noticed that Malonchomala lay there, exhausted and worn.

Now it was time for Malonchomala's maternal family, the tigers from the jungle, to act. They descended upon the land of the fair-skinned king and laid it to waste. The grandeur of the royal palace, the horses, the elephants—nothing was left uneaten. Perhaps even the king and queen would not have been spared if not for Malonchomala's request. Only the princess Kanchanmala, known as Kanchi, was spared, along with the rest of the royal family. Malonchomala had only one plea—to let her husband live in peace\!

No teeth, no king, no house, no home—yet Malonchomala's heart is at peace, for Chandramanik is free\! After many years, the king was reunited with his prince. His joy knew no bounds. Plans were made to return to their own kingdom immediately. The palanquin, horses, and chariots were all arranged. But alas, what about Malonchomala? No one seemed to care about her. Poor Malonchomala was left behind, sitting by the roadside. Her only companions were the tiger, tigress, and Malini from the land of the milk-white king. They all came to lift her up and comfort her.

Meanwhile, the king, along with Kanchanmala and Chandramanik, returned to the kingdom with great fanfare, accompanied by the beating of drums. Malonchomala followed behind them, sneaking glances into their home from time to time, checking on how her husband and his new bride were faring. One day, however, she was caught in the act. Chandramanik demanded to know her true identity. After all those years of keeping her secret, Malonchomala finally had to reveal who she was. Yet, knowing the truth brought no salvation—no sooner had she confessed than the king’s guards arrived and seized the unfortunate Kotal's daughter.

Once again, Malonchomala was forcibly exiled from the kingdom. The moment her feet crossed the boundary, chaos descended upon the realm. The palace gates crumbled, stars fell from the sky, and fires erupted in the distance. Even in the royal chambers, where seven sons were born to the prince, none survived beyond their infancy. Meanwhile, wherever Malonchomala walked, flowers bloomed in her wake, filling the air with their sweet fragrance.

Days passed in this manner. Malonchomala now lived deep in the forest, far from the royal palace. But her fate was still tied to that of the kingdom—could she truly escape it so easily? One day, the king went out for a hunt. In the midst of his expedition, he lost his way. No matter which direction he took, it felt like he was trapped in a labyrinth. As he wandered, the king grew weary and finally knelt down, calling out in a sorrowful voice, "Water, just a little water\!"

From a dilapidated yet beautifully arranged cottage in the forest emerged a stunning girl. Just seeing her seemed to quench one’s thirst and cool the mind. She approached the king slowly and offered him a vessel of icy-cold water. Grateful for the refreshing drink, the king asked, “Who are you, dear? How did you come to give me water in this dense jungle? I have never seen you before.”

With a sweet smile, Malonchomala introduced herself to the king, embodying a purity untouched by her hardships. Overcome with embarrassment, the king lowered his gaze. He immediately wished to take her back as the queen of his kingdom. However, Malonchomala explained that her home was now in the forest. The king insisted on not letting her go, asking for forgiveness for all his past wrongs, stating that this time she must come with him\!

Then Malonchomala went to bid farewell to her uncle and aunt in the forest, as her long wait was finally over. Overjoyed, she sprinkled the oil of seven lamps over the remnants of those who had perished. One by one, everyone in the kingdom revived. Flowers bloomed on the trees, and birds began to sing. With Malonchomala’s touch, the land experienced an eternal spring. It seemed as if she held the power of life and death in her hands\!

# **The tale of Molua**

[The tale of Molua (otibeguni.com)](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/the-tale-of-molua)

At that time, the country was going through an unseasonal period of rain. The autumn paddy was being destroyed by the downpour. During this time, a widow and her son, Chand Binod, were struggling to survive. In search of some extra income, Binod took up hunting kites or eagles. One day, he went to the pond bank in the village of Aralia to hunt kites. As he became exhausted while hunting, he sat under a tree to rest and soon fell asleep. Evening was approaching then. At that moment, Molua, the young daughter of the village chief in Aralia, came to the riverbank to fetch water.

As Binod slept, evening approached.  

"Who are you, sleeping alone by the riverbank?"  

The sister of seven brothers, Molua, came to fetch water,  

While the young man lay alone at the water's edge.

Seeing him lying under the tree, her heart filled with compassion. She thought, "If his sleep breaks in the middle of the night, where will this foreign traveler go?" Molua wondered where this young man would stay during the night. So, she tapped her water pitcher to make a sound, hoping the noise would wake him from his slumber.

Binod awoke to find a beautiful young woman standing before him in the dim evening light. Her beauty seemed to brighten the surroundings like the evening lamp. Seeing her, Binod was both astonished and enchanted. He asked, "Whose daughter are you—whose woman—where is your home?" In response, Molua revealed her identity. Upon learning her identity, Binod surrendered his heart to her. Expressing his deep affection, he said, "I’ve left my soul here at this riverbank\!"

On the other hand, the young woman Molua was no less captivated. She, too, had fallen for Binod. Seeing his moon-like beautiful face, a wave of spring passed through her heart. She thought to herself:

"A foreign man, like the moon I see,  

Blushes bloomed on the maiden's youth, tender and free."

Enchanted by Molua's beauty, Binod expressed his desire to marry her and sent a matchmaker to her home through his mother. However, this is where the trouble began. Molua’s father objected to the marriage because of Binod's poor status. Although he initially refused, he later agreed. Binod married Molua, and she moved to his home. There, her beauty caught the lustful eyes of the local kazi, who became infatuated with her.

The kazi tried to tempt her, saying, "Seeing your beauty, the kazi has become obsessed. I will fill your body with pure gold." In protest, Molua boldly replied, "My husband isn't home, or I would tell you—if he were, I’d strike your cunning head with a broom\!"

The furious kazi, determined to control Molua, began persecuting Binod. He auctioned off Binod's property and issued a warrant in his name. He demanded a dowry for the marriage and threatened to confiscate their home and land. Despite her family’s dire situation, Molua remained steadfast in her resolve. Binod, feeling weakened by the pressure, asked Molua to return to her father’s house. But Molua dismissed the idea and firmly told Binod:

"Even if I eat simple greens and rice, and live under a tree,  

At the end of the day, seeing your face will make me happy."

The furious kazi, determined to control Molua, began persecuting Binod. He auctioned off Binod's property and issued a warrant in his name. He demanded a dowry for the marriage and threatened to confiscate their home and land. Despite her family’s dire situation, Molua remained steadfast in her resolve. Binod, feeling weakened by the pressure, asked Molua to return to her father’s house. But Molua dismissed the idea and firmly told Binod:

"Even if I eat simple greens and rice, and live under a tree,  

At the end of the day, seeing your face will make me happy."

Molua continued to endure extreme hardship. One day, Binod returned home after earning some money abroad, and their once happy life resumed. Days were going well, but the kazi still couldn't forget Molua. Upon hearing of Binod's return, the kazi sought to intensify the pressure on Molua and enlisted the local Dewan to help. The Dewan, following the kazi's orders, plotted to torture Binod and have him buried alive.

Upon learning of the plot, Molua summoned her five brothers using their trained kites, and they rescued Binod. Though Binod was freed, the kazi's men captured Molua and presented her as a gift to the Dewan. When the Dewan expressed his desire to marry her, Molua, holding firm to her principles, told him about a vow she had taken and asked him to wait for three months.

Molua endured all the sorrows, hardships, and suffering in her life with a smile, thanks to Binod's love. However, even after escaping from the Dewan's control, Binod's relatives questioned her chastity. Furthermore, influenced by their words, Binod also began to doubt Molua, accusing her of being unworthy to join the family after spending three months in another man's house. Eventually, Binod abandoned her, and their society refused to accept her as well.

Though Molua's brothers wanted to take her away, she remained in Binod's home, like a servant. Meanwhile, Binod remarried. One day, when Binod was bitten by a snake, Molua took him to a healer and saved his life. Witnessing this, all the neighbors urged Binod to bring Molua back into his home.

In the east, a storm roared fiercely.  

There are no shores, no landing places by this sea.  

“Let it sink, let it sink, how much farther can it go?  

As I drown, I see how far the underworld is.”  

The storm raged fiercely in the east,  

Where did the beautiful girl, the boat of the mind and heart, go?  

Thus ends the tale of Molua,  

A tragic story from the Mymensingh Gitika.

# **The tale of Madhob and Maloncho**

[The tale of Madhob and Maloncho (otibeguni.com)](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/the-tale-of-madhob-and-maloncho)

Once upon a time, long ago, there lived a king in a certain land. Like most kings and nobles, his treasury was overflowing with wealth. In the elephant stable, the elephants trumpeted joyfully, and in the horse stable, the horses sharpened their hooves. He had plenty of people and soldiers. Yet, there was one sorrow in the king's heart—he had no children. What use is such wealth and prosperity if there is no heir to carry on the family legacy? The king spent his days in deep sorrow.

One day, in his deep sorrow, the king decided to end his life in the dense forest. It was midnight. Seeing the distressed king, Shiva and Parvati appeared before him. After listening to all of the king's woes, Shiva granted him a boon, promising that a beautiful child would soon be born to him. Filled with joy, the king returned to his palace. Shiva's boon came to fruition quickly, and a beautiful daughter was born in the royal palace—her name was Maloncho.

Maloncho grew up happily, and there was no lack of anything in her life. To share in her joy, she had Madhob, the son of the chief minister, as her companion. They ate together, studied together, and played together. Thus, twelve happy years passed, and their childhood friendship blossomed into love. However, the question nagged at Madhob: would the son of a minister be able to unite with the king's daughter? One day, he decided to confront her, saying that Maloncho must promise to marry him; otherwise, they could no longer be together.

“The swan lives in water,  

The parrot resides in the tree.  

What Madhob says is true,  

Maloncho, I will marry you, indeed.”

But no one else was aware of the secret feelings between the princess and the minister's son. Therefore, the king decided to arrange Malonchos marriage to another prince. When they heard this, it felt like a thunderbolt struck the hearts of the lovebirds. They had promised each other\! After some thought, they resolved to run away together. Maloncho asked Madhob to bring a boat made of pawan wood, oars made of hiramun wood, and a steering made of mon mon wood. Madhob immediately set out to find these materials.

But three long months passed, and Madhob could not find the hiramun wood, nor the pawan wood, nor the mon mon wood. In his despair, he lay down under a tree in the forest. Suddenly, he heard voices coming from among the branches. It was a magical parrot and mynah, conversing about him\! Curious, Madhob leaned in to listen closely to what they were saying.

**Parrot:**  

“Who is this again? Where did he come from?  

Indeed, he has come, but why is he sitting here?”  

**Moyna:**  

“This is Madhob, here for wood,  

Without the wood, the marriage will be completely off\!  

Then Maloncho will go to the prince’s home,  

And the prince will give her golden and diamond sarees.”  

**Parrot:**   

“Oh\! What wood do you need? What wood do you seek?  

Is there none here in this place?”  

**Moyna:**    

“Stay in the forest, do you not know the woods?”  

“Whose boat has been here all this time?”  

—“No one’s.”  

“Whose is it now?”  

—“Yours.”  

“If it is mine, then take it to Malonchos palace right away.”  

As soon as the words were spoken, the enchanted boat flew swiftly, taking Madhob to Malonchos home, where the wedding festivities were already underway. Maloncho was busy with Shiva's worship, and through her singing, she conveyed to Madhob to wait for her in the boat. Meanwhile, before Shiva, the princess requested a boon that everyone in the kingdom should fall unconscious until she could escape with Madhob. Shiva listened to the devotee's plea once again, and according to Malonchos wishes, the task was accomplished. However, unbeknownst to both Madhob and Maloncho, another danger was lurking nearby.

In the kingdom, there lived a treacherous thief known for his terrifying nature, who offered young maidens as sacrifices. He had set his sights on Maloncho and was now hiding in the enchanted boat, disguised as Madhob. When Maloncho reached the boat, she realized the deception, but it was too late. The treacherous thief took Maloncho to his home, where he shattered the magical boat to prevent Madhob and Maloncho from reuniting. Later, as he went to the blacksmith's house to forge a new sword, Maloncho heard eerie laughter coming from the well beside the house. With trepidation, she approached the well to investigate.

“Who laughs in the well?”  

“We are the souls of a hundred maidens, victims of the treacherous thief.”  

The spirits of the hundred maidens informed Maloncho that if she could somehow kill the treacherous thief and pour even a drop of his blood into the well, they would all come back to life. They also revealed to her that if she headed east of the house, she would find a fairy-like horse. The solution to her problem lay with that horse. Determined, Maloncho devised a plan to confront the treacherous thief.

After a while, the thief returned home and asked Maloncho to pay homage to his deity. Maloncho replied, “I am the king’s daughter—I cannot bow down. Teach me how.” Just as the thief leaned in to teach her how to bow, Maloncho seized the opportunity and struck him with the sword, decapitating him in one swift blow. She then took a drop of his blood and poured it into the center of the well, where the souls of the hundred maidens had mourned. In an instant, all of them came back to life.

Maloncho used a rope to pull each of them up one by one, providing them with food and clothing to restore their strength. After ensuring they were well taken care of, she sent them back to their respective homes. Thus, under the brave hand of the princess, one hundred maidens were freed, and the terrifying treacherous thief met his end.

So much had transpired, yet Madhob remained oblivious to it all. How could he know? Under Shiva's blessing, everyone in the kingdom had fallen unconscious, and Madhob was among them. As soon as Maloncho left the kingdom, he regained his senses. Looking around, he noticed that the wedding festivities were still ongoing. But alas, where was Maloncho? He searched inside and outside the palace and across the entire kingdom, but he could not find her anywhere.

Having saved the lives of a hundred maidens, Maloncho rode the fairy-like horse and galloped away from the thief's house, losing all sense of direction. It felt like she was embarking on an adventure to explore the world. Eventually, she arrived in the land of a mysterious king. There, she bid farewell to the horse and sat beneath a tree, waiting. Before long, the king himself came to meet her. However, Maloncho was not in her feminine form; she had disguised herself as a man for convenience during her journey. Yet, even in disguise, could the radiance of her beauty truly be hidden?

The king offered Maloncho a job, and she agreed. However, she had one peculiar condition: she requested a house surrounded by a high fence where she could live alone, and not even a bird should enter without her permission. The king accepted her terms without hesitation.

Maloncho lived in the house, working for the king while often reminiscing about Madhob. Meanwhile, Madhob faced his own hardships as he searched for Maloncho, traveling from one kingdom to another. One day, fate led him to Malonchos kingdom, but their reunion wasn't going to be easy. In this realm resided a wicked sorceress who enchanted any prince she desired, turning them into sheep to use at her whims.

Upon seeing Madhob, the sorceress was immediately drawn to him. Using her cunning tricks, she cast a spell on him, transforming him into a sheep by day while allowing him to retain his human form at night. Thus, Madhob's days became a struggle between his animal existence and the fleeting moments of his true self under the moonlight.

In the royal palace, Malonchos days were not bad. One day, she caught the attention of the princess. The princess was enchanted by Maloncho's masculine appearance. However, Maloncho did not realize this; her thoughts kept wandering back to Madhob.

One day, a royal court was convened, and everyone was present— the princess, Maloncho, and the minister. During this time, news arrived that a terrifying demon was wreaking havoc in the kingdom. No one could defeat it, as it was taking whoever it wanted from their homes. The king declared, "Whoever slays the demon shall have the princess as their reward." However, no one was able to succeed in this task, and people were disappearing in groups at the hands of the demon.

Then the king called Maloncho aside and told her about the demon, requesting that she must kill it, no matter how. No sooner said than done. Maloncho mounted her magical horse and flew faster than the wind—soaring through the skies. She reached the jungle where the demon resided. Upon arrival, she saw the demon, who, after devouring thousands of people, was resting comfortably, taking a nap.

Maloncho had a gun with her. She thought, "This is the perfect moment." Without even setting foot on the ground, she fired her gun from the sky. The bullet hit the demon straight in the head. The demon fell right there, utterly defeated\! With no one around to help him, the demon had no chance to fight back. His death was certain. Maloncho then cut off the demon’s head and brought it back to show the king.

The king was overjoyed upon receiving the demon's head. He declared the reward: "The one who slays the demon shall marry the princess\!" Maloncho was thunderstruck. How could this be possible? But defying the king’s decree would cost her life. So, Maloncho agreed with a condition:

"Your Majesty, in our country, the marriage ceremony first takes place with the sword. Only after six months is the groom wedded. If you agree to this custom, then I am fully on board."

The king was very fond of Maloncho, so he agreed to this condition as well. But six months is not a long time. One by one, the six months passed, and Maloncho still couldn't find Madhob. With no other choice, she brought the princess home. That night, a sharp sword was placed between them, and Maloncho said to the princess, "Move even a little, and your life will be at risk\!" The princess behaved accordingly.

One night, Maloncho had a dream where she was told to sacrifice a hundred rams and dig a pond. Upon waking, she went to the king and said, “We must dig a pond—bring a hundred rams.” The king sent messengers with drums and trumpets throughout the kingdom, declaring that by any means necessary, they must gather a hundred rams\! 

Coincidentally, those hundred magical rams belonged to the same wicked sorceress, who had once enchanted Madhob. However, by this time, the sorceress was no longer alive.

As the preparations for the sacrifice continued, Maloncho noticed that the hundred rams needed to be bathed in the pond before the ritual. Among them, one ram stood out—it was strikingly beautiful, with silver horns that gleamed in the light. Maloncho was particularly drawn to this ram and felt an inexplicable connection. She decided to set it aside while the remaining ninety-nine rams were led into the pond.

When the sorceress had turned the princes into rams, she had placed a magical branch on their heads to keep them under the spell. As the rams were bathed in the pond, each one’s magical branch fell off, and the princes regained their human form. Witnessing this, Maloncho grew suspicious. She turned to the princess and said, “Let’s take this special ram to the palace and give it a proper bath.” The princess, already enamored by the beauty of the ram, agreed readily.

Once in the palace, as soon as they bathed the ram, the magical branch fell from its head, and there stood a handsome young man—none other than Maloncho's long-lost Madhob. Seeing his striking appearance, the princess also found herself smitten. Maloncho, however, couldn’t help but smile quietly to herself, knowing the truth.

Since Maloncho was disguised as a man, Madhob initially did not recognize him. Allowing Madhob to rest, Maloncho went into the inner palace. She shed her male form and donned a beautiful saree, then slowly approached Madhob. Before that, she explained everything to the princess, who surprisingly didn’t mind, as she had already fallen for Madhob.

Maloncho said, “Just as you are a princess, I am too. May Madhob be yours as well as mine.” With that, Maloncho took both Madhob and the princess to the king and revealed the whole story. In a grand celebration, the weddings of both princesses to Madhob took place, uniting Madhob and Maloncho as well. Thus, they all lived happily and peacefully together.

# **The tale of Bahram Badshah**

[The tale of Bahram Badshah (otibeguni.com)](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/the-tale-of-bahram-badshah)

There was once a king named Bahram. Like other kings, he had granaries full of grain, a treasury overflowing with wealth, and a kingdom of subjects. However, unlike many others, this king was not cruel. He had a heart full of kindness and compassion. Whoever stood at his door asking for something, he would grant it without a second thought. This king was a truly generous soul. But this habit of giving brought misfortune upon him. Despite his goodwill toward everyone, his luck began to turn. And the bringer of this ill fate was none other than a beggar who stood at the king’s door one day.

One day, the beggar approached the king and said, "I've heard that you are a great benefactor, that anyone who asks for something receives it. Will my request be granted at the door of this merciful king?"

True to his nature, the king replied, "Ask without fear, whatever it is that you desire. If it is within my power, you shall surely have it, I assure you."

The beggar revealed his desire, and upon hearing it, the courtiers were struck with shock and horror—"Choose one, O King—your kingdom or your faith. Whichever you leave behind shall be this beggar's to claim."

If he gave up his kingdom, the king would have to live a life of hardship in this world. But his faith? That was the greatest treasure for the afterlife. The devout king, with a heavy heart, replied to the beggar, "This world I do not know, but the next, I understand well. Take away my kingdom, it is yours to claim."

With these words, the king handed over all the keys, treasures, and wealth to the beggar and, with his family, set off towards the wilderness. There was no food, no shelter. The grandeur of kingship had vanished, leaving behind only poverty and hunger. The princes grew restless from the gnawing hunger and the exhaustion of the journey. Seeing her children suffer so, the queen could bear it no longer. She took off her golden bangles and set out in search of a merchant who could offer them something in exchange.

With hope in her heart, the queen believed that selling her bangles would at least provide food for her children. But upon reaching the riverbank, she found no merchant in sight. In despair, she sat down by the river and wept. Just then, she saw a ship sailing down the river, laden with a merchant's goods. A glimmer of hope returned to her heart. She approached the ship. Meanwhile, the sight of the beautiful queen stirred wicked thoughts in the mind of the merchant aboard. He devised a plan to deceive her and get her onto the ship. 

When the queen asked for money in exchange for her bangles, the merchant, pretending to buy them, coaxed her onto the ship. As soon as she boarded, the ship set sail. The queen quickly realized the terrible mistake she had made, but by then, there was no way to return.

Meanwhile, the condition of the king and the princes was far from good. As they waited for the queen, a long time passed. Eventually, they set out in search of her, heading in a different direction. They soon arrived at the riverbank, but how were they to cross? Before them lay a small dinghy, too small to carry all three at once. 

The king decided to place his younger son in the boat and crossed the river first with him. He tied his older son to a tree using reeds and vines from the marsh, intending to return for him after safely crossing with the younger one.

But fate had other plans\! Wherever the unfortunate king turned, the river seemed to dry up further. His luck was as grim as the circumstances. While attempting to return for his older son after leaving the younger one safely in the boat, the dinghy began to sink. Now, one son was on either bank of the river, while their father struggled in the middle of the water, fighting to stay afloat. Meanwhile, their mother was imprisoned on a wicked merchant's ship\!

Thus, two days passed. The king managed to survive, somehow clinging to life, but he had not yet drowned in the river. After finally reaching the bank, thoughts of his children occupied his mind, while his sons were facing their own twisted fates.

The older son had been crying out for help since the moment he was tied to the tree. Unfortunately, a tiger came along and took him away. However, a brave hunter intervened and rescued the prince from the tiger’s grasp. Meanwhile, the younger prince was left alone, weeping in despair, with no one around to hear him. His cries of sorrow caught the attention of a fisherman and his wife, who felt pity for him. 

The older brother was taken to the hunter’s home, while the younger one became the companion of the fisherman. Thus, those destined for royalty found themselves living in the humble abodes of a hunter and a fisherman, their fates having taken a remarkable turn.

Having lost his family, the distraught King Bahram wandered aimlessly, searching for anyone but finding no one. One day, his travels led him to a strange city called Khorram. Recently, the king of this city had passed away, and the queen was in a state of confusion, unsure of what to do next. Seeking guidance, she turned to her vizier.

The vizier suggested, “Release the king’s mad elephant—whoever it encounters will be chosen as the queen’s companion.”

Thus, King Bahram was being sought in the city of Khorram. What a strange twist of fate\! At that very moment, a king who had lost everything was wandering outside his kingdom. The mad elephant, wandering around, stopped right in front of the unfortunate king. With its head swaying and trunk waving, it lifted Bahram and placed him upon the royal throne.

He regained a queen, a kingdom, subjects, and riches—all of it—but he had lost his original family. Yet, what magic there is in the throne\! It seemed that the king forgot all about his past. He continued to govern his kingdom in happiness, embracing his new life.

Do you remember the two sons of the king? The ones who later became the son of a hunter and the son of a fisherman? They have now grown up. Having completed their studies, they work in the royal palace. However, they do not recognize each other and continue to live as strangers, going about their tasks. Yet, due to their skills and dedication, they have become the most trusted servants of the royal household.

The former king of Khorram had a merchant friend who traded goods by sea, traveling to various lands. After a long absence, he was returning home and thought, “It would be nice to visit my friend\!” However, upon arrival, he learned that his friend had passed away many years ago. Nevertheless, the current king was not a bad person. He warmly welcomed the merchant, offering him great hospitality. A grand celebration was organized at the royal palace, complete with music and festivities, creating a lavish gathering.

The merchant hesitated slightly before agreeing to the gathering, saying, “But my new friend, my wife is on the ship\! How can I leave her behind…” The new king reassured him, “No worries at all\! You need not think about it. I will send my two most trusted servants to keep an eye on your wife right away. You enjoy yourself and have fun.”

At the royal palace, festivities and merriment were in full swing, while the two brothers, unaware of their true identities, went to keep watch over the merchant's wife. Once there, they joined the ship's crew in a lively conversation, sharing tales of joy and sorrow. They recounted stories from their childhood, including the time they lost their parents and the hardships they faced, as well as the encounter with the beggar. The atmosphere was filled with nostalgia, laughter, and a sense of camaraderie as they bonded over their shared experiences.

In this story, the brothers recognized each other and embraced as the two princes of the royal family. Meanwhile, hidden away, the merchant's wife, who was actually their long-lost mother—the queen—listened to everything. The heartfelt reunion of mother and sons took place, and tears of joy filled their eyes. However, just as they were basking in their happiness, the king's guards arrived and seized them. They accused them of a grave offense, questioning their behavior with the merchant's wife. The tension mounted as the royal authority confronted the reunited family, setting the stage for a dramatic turn of events.

Then the two brothers began to share their detailed story with the king. They recounted how the threads of their lives had been torn apart and how their family had become separated due to the whims of fate. With every word they spoke, the king shed more tears. No matter how much he ruled over another kingdom or lived with another queen, he couldn't forget his own wife and children. Memories flooded back to him. Meanwhile, the merchant watched, helplessly aware that in just a short while, he would face execution.

# **The tale of Kusum Bibi**

[The tale of Kusum Bibi (otibeguni.com)](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/the-tale-of-kusum-bibi)

It was a long time ago. In the city of Rome, there lived a childless king named Sher Shah. He had not one, but seven queens in his palace. The youngest of these queens was named Kusum. When this youngest queen became pregnant, the king’s affection for her grew significantly. Because of this, the other six queens could not tolerate Kusum.

During childbirth, the senior queen conspired with the midwife and secretly replaced Queen Kusum's baby with a wooden doll, making it seem as though Kusum had given birth to the doll. The real baby was taken to the senior queen's chambers. The queen immediately commanded the midwife, “Take this child away from my sight and kill it with a sharp weapon.” However, the midwife, filled with compassion, couldn’t bring herself to kill the child. Instead, she decided to leave the kingdom and take the baby to another land, sparing its life.

Meanwhile, in the town of Shyamsundar, the vizier Kalander also had no children. The midwife, carrying the baby, went to Kalander’s house and offered to sell the child. The midwife told the vizier, “The baby has no father, and the mother passed away during childbirth. The child is now my responsibility—but I am unable to raise it on my own.” After hearing everything, the vizier went to discuss the matter with his wives.

The vizier's wives said, "We can keep the baby on one condition—buy us a milking cow\! The child will drink its milk and will not suffer any harm." The midwife and the vizier both agreed to this proposal. Soon after, the vizier made a grand announcement throughout the kingdom, with drums beating and fanfare, proclaiming that he had a newborn son.

Meanwhile, a servant named Kalu went to inform Sher Shah that his youngest queen, Kusum, had given birth to a wooden doll. The king, refusing to believe this, first went to hear from his six elder queens. Each of them, one by one, confirmed the story. Angered by what he heard, the king imprisoned Queen Kusum and declared that the matter would be judged the following morning in the royal court.

The next morning, Queen Kusum was brought to the royal court in chains. In the court, she pleaded, "It was no wooden doll; a son was born to me—known to all, friend and foe alike. My son’s name is Askhan, and the heavens would split open for him." However, since the child was not present, the king berated her. Kusum fell at her husband's feet, begging for mercy. But the king, still enraged, stripped her of her eight ornaments and left her in disgrace.

Then the king commanded Kaloo to cut Kusum's hair, pour mud over her head, and hang the wooden doll around her neck, while pushing her out of the kingdom. Along with that, the king also ordered that Queen Kusum be banished to the forest for twelve years. As per the king's orders, this was carried out. The queen was sent deep into the forest.

Kusum walked through the forest, and as night fell, she began to feel afraid—thinking that a tiger would eat her in this dense jungle. Then she saw a flickering light a little distance ahead. She thought to herself, “I’ll spend the night there and leave in the morning.”

Kusum approached the house and pleaded with the homeowner to allow her to stay for one night. The homeowner agreed but set one condition: she must leave before dawn. After spending the night there, Kusum set out at first light toward her parents' home. Upon arriving, she embraced her mother and, in tears, recounted everything that had happened during her banishment.

But Kusum's father did not allow her to enter the house. Ironically, she was now a queen in distress, with nowhere to go. With no other option, she went to her brother's house, but there too, she found no refuge and was driven away. Heartbroken, Kusum retreated into the forest, crying out the name of her newborn son, Askan. In the forest lived countless tigers, and upon hearing the name Askan, they compassionately built her a small hut from palm and bel leaves for shelter. Kusum managed to survive by begging for food, making do with whatever little she could gather each day.

Before long, twelve years passed—twelve winters and twelve springs. But could a mother ever forget her child? One day, while going to school through the forest path, little Askan happened to see Kusum. Upon seeing her, he called out from the depths of his heart, "Mother\!" With the pain of being separated from her son, Kusum replied, "Come, my child, drink your mother's milk."

Askan continued to drink Kusum's milk with unending satisfaction, and meanwhile, the school hours came to an end. After finishing his meal, Kusum asked Askan for food and inquired about his lineage. Askan promised her that he would find out from his mother and would return with food as well.

Askan, upon asking the midwife about his true lineage, learned the entire story. Crying, he returned to the forest to meet Kusum. After twelve years, the mother and son were reunited, both overwhelmed with emotion. Then, Askan took his mother, Kusum, to the court of King Sher Shah. There, all the hidden truths from the years were revealed, and King Sher Shah sentenced the elder queen to death, deeply regretting her actions.

Finally, everyone was reunited. King Sher Shah began to rule the kingdom happily with Queen Kusum and their son, Askan. Thus, the tale of Queen Kusum came to an end.

# **The tale of Behula-Lakhindar**

[The tale of Behula-Lakhindar (otibeguni.com)](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/the-tale-of-behula-lakhindar)

Once upon a time, merchants were making great profits through sea trade. In the city of Champai lived a hot-tempered and daring merchant named Chand Soudagar. People also called him Chand Bena. Chand Soudagar was a great devotee of Mahadev, meaning the supreme god Shiva. He cared for no one else but his deity.

Meanwhile, a conflict arose in Kailash between Shiva and the serpent goddess Manasa. Manasa felt immense sorrow. Although her father had granted her the status of a goddess, people on Earth still did not worship her. On the other hand, Mahadev had told her, "You will meet my dear devotee, Chand Soudagar, on Earth."

He had set a condition: only if she could receive worship from him would she be recognized as a goddess in the mortal realm. With that in mind, Manasa prepared herself and set off toward Earth. Her only goal was to make Chand Soudagar worship her, thereby securing her status as a goddess among the people of the mortal world. However, Chand Soudagar was not an easy person to sway. There was no one in the surrounding areas as obstinate as he was.

No matter what, he would not worship Manasa. He had received the "Maha Jnana" mantra from Shiva. With this mantra, whenever Manasa tried to come and seek worship, Chand Soudagar thwarted all her plans. 

One day, using tricks and deceit, Manasa managed to get her hands on that mantra from the merchant. With the protective charm gone, she saw an opportunity. Chand Soudagar had a childhood friend named Dhanwantari, who possessed miraculous powers. With Dhanwantari's help, Chand was saved on this journey, but Dhanwantari was ultimately destroyed in Manasa's wrath.

Returning home, a storm erupted in the sea. Chand Soudagar's ship, the "Shaptadinga Madhukar," was swept away by the waves. He lost all his wealth and riches, and all his companions were gone. With only his life left, he wandered the roads as a beggar. Yet, Chand's stubbornness remained; he would never worship Manasa. He was a great devotee of Shiva\! How could he worship another? After much penance, he succeeded in pleasing Shiva once again and received blessings from him.

With the blessings of Mahadev, Chand gradually began to regain everything he had lost. Happiness returned to his household. Chand and his wife, Sonka, welcomed their seventh son, Lakhindar, into their lives. He had already lost six sons, and now only this little boy remained. At the same time, in the affluent family of his friend Soya Ben in Ujaninagar, a beautiful baby girl was born. She was named Behula. From a young age, Behula and Lakhindar laughed and played together, fostering a deep bond of love and friendship between their families.

As they both grew older, it was decided that Behula would marry Chand Soadagar's only surviving son, Lakhindar. In Hindu tradition, horoscopes are matched before a wedding, and this was no exception for Behula and Lakhindar's union. However, fate had other plans\! The results of their horoscopes revealed an unprecedented outcome that no one had ever seen before.

The fortune-tellers determined that on the wedding night, the young Lakhindar would be bitten by a snake, leading to his death. However, there was no mention of widowhood in Behula's fate. After much deliberation, everyone decided that going ahead with the wedding was the best course of action. Besides, both the groom and bride were devoted followers of the goddess Manasa, and perhaps she would show her mercy.

But the goddess's wrath was too powerful, affecting the heavens, earth, and even the netherworld. The wedding night of Behula and Lakhindar finally arrived. Chandra Soadagar devised another plan to thwart the goddess. He had a skilled craftsman build an iron wedding chamber for his son and daughter-in-law, ensuring that there would be no gaps or openings for a snake to enter. After all, if a snake was to bite, where would it come from?

However, it didn't take long for the goddess to learn of Soadagar's conspiracy. She appeared in the dreams of the very craftsman who was tasked with building the chamber. The goddess warned him, threateningly, to leave a small gap in the iron chamber, just enough for a thread to pass through. The craftsman thought to himself, "What difference could a mere thread make?" So, he decided to heed the goddess's words, ensuring he kept her instructions in mind while also following Soadagar's wishes.

The craftsman, trying to keep both parties satisfied while also saving his own life, completed the iron chamber as instructed. It was a formidable structure, with cold iron surrounding the newlyweds in the center. Meanwhile, the goddess Manasa, in the form of a serpent, entered the chamber through the thread-like gap. Silently and swiftly, she struck the sleeping Lakhindar, and with that, he lost his life.

When Behula woke up in the morning, she found her husband Lakhindar lying dead beside her. Devastated and determined, she knew that in their village, people would float the body on a banana tree raft after a snakebite. They did the same with Lakhindar, but Behula was resolute; she insisted on accompanying him. Not only that, but she vowed to journey to the heavenly realms to retrieve her husband's soul.

With Lakhindar's body beside her, Behula embarked on a long journey of six months. Throughout the trek, she faced numerous obstacles and challenges, yet nothing could deter her. Driven by her oath to save her husband, she remained steadfast and committed, ready to confront whatever lay ahead.

After six long months, Behula's raft finally arrived at Nita's ghat. Many people affectionately called her "Ma Nito." By chance, she was the foster mother of Goddess Mansa. Seeing the devoted and virtuous Behula in such dire straits due to her foster daughter's curse filled Ma Nito with compassion. 

She said to Behula, "Come with me. I will take you to the court of Indra. There, you will surely find a way to bring your husband back to life." With renewed hope, Behula followed Ma Nito, ready to face whatever challenges awaited her in the heavenly realm.

In the meantime, Lakhindar's body had started to decay. With the help of Ma Nito, Behula reached the heavenly realm, the court of Indra, carrying her husband's deteriorating body. Once there, she performed a dance so mesmerizing that everyone present was captivated. How could they not be? In her previous life, Behula was a celestial dancer known as Usha, and Lakhindar was the heavenly dancer Aniruddha. 

This divine couple had been sent to Earth by Ma Mansa to collect offerings in her honor. Understanding the divine play is a great burden\!

In this life, even the goddess Manasa had to yield to Behula's steadfast courage and love. She agreed to restore the lives of Chand Saodagar's six deceased sons and Lakhindar on one condition: that Mahajedi Chand Saodagar would worship Manasa.

However, Saodagar would break, but he wouldn't bend. After all, Manasa had caused him much harm. How could he easily forget? So, although he agreed to the terms of worship, he offered it with his left hand. Despite feeling anger in her heart, the goddess showed no lack of compassion and forgave Saodagar. With that left-handed worship, she returned to the heavenly realm. From that time, Manasa became not only the goddess of heaven but also the goddess of the earthly realm of death.

Even now, in Chattogram, there exists the pond of Chand Sawdagar, and in Bogura, there lie the ruins of the cursed bridal chamber of Behula and Lakhindar. Though the history of the Puranas has grown old, people still remember the tale of Behula's love for her husband and Chand Sawdagar's stubbornness in a new tune. It narrates the enduring struggle of the Bengali woman, embodied in the story of a woman adrift in a boat.

# **Soul Catcher**

[https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/soul-catcher](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/soul-catcher)

Once upon a time, in a kingdom, there lived a wicked king and his equally wicked queen. Together, they inflicted countless atrocities upon their subjects. If anyone made the slightest mistake, the soldiers would take their head. The maidservants lived in constant fear, always anxious that a single misstep might cost them their lives\! If a spoonful of sugar was missing or if a maid happened to glance at the queen the wrong way while she was getting ready— that was it\! In this wicked king's realm, no one was safe. The fields of golden rice swayed under the sun, and the clear streams flowed through the forests and jungles. Although there was no compassion for the king, everyone loved the kingdom dearly.

In truth, the king found no peace within himself. This inner turmoil fueled his harsh treatment of others, creating an atmosphere of unrest. Each year would begin with joy, but as the months passed, the king would sink deeper into despair. His sorrow cast a shadow over everyone in the kingdom, affecting their spirits as well.

That autumn, as the year turned, the king's days of well-being came to an end. One day, he fell gravely ill, his head pounding with pain so intense that he could barely stand. It became impossible for him to focus on the affairs of the kingdom; he could only scream in agony. Despite the presence of countless physicians summoned by the queen, none could cure the ailing king.

And with the king's terrible temper, one by one, he had all the physicians executed. Soon, there were no healers left in the kingdom. Meanwhile, whispers spread among the people, "What will cure the king's illness?" Such an arrogant king, no one really cared much if he remained unwell. But because he was the king, they had to keep paying attention.

But all the physicians had been executed. Where would a new healer be found? In fact, the few who remained alive, out of fear of punishment, were also reluctant to step forward. Who would risk their life for the king’s temper—life isn’t that cheap, is it? Not just the physicians, but also the herbalists and magicians were summoned. They had to come and cure the king's illness. Some magicians attempted to speak the truth but stopped, fearing the king's wrath\! Then, a brave sorcerer stood at the king's door.

However, when the sorcerer approached the king, he began to tremble with fear. Gathering some courage, he said, "Forgive me, Your Majesty\! I have never seen such an illness in my life. There can only be one reason for this illness. In your previous life, you were a dog, and..." Before he could finish his words, the king's sword had already severed his neck. Upon hearing this news, the remaining sorcerers and herbalists quickly packed their bags and fled the kingdom.

The king's illness worsened day by day, with no relief in sight. Many days passed in this way. One day, a servant from the palace approached the queen with news. He told her about a great sage who lived at the peak of a mountain at the farthest edge of the kingdom. This hermit, no matter the storm, rain, or any other calamity, never left his ashram. The servant mentioned that the sage possessed immense medicinal powers and would surely be able to cure the king.

Hearing this, it was as if sunlight broke through the clouds. The queen regained hope and sent word to the sage through the loyal servant. However, the sage initially refused, saying, "This king has caused harm to many—executing innocent people without reason and driving harmless subjects out of his kingdom. I do not wish to become a partner in his sins by treating him." 

But the servant, who had served the sage for many years, humbly asked for one small favor in return for his years of service—the king's life. Reluctantly, the sage agreed but imposed one strange condition.

"I will not leave my ashram to go to the palace. The king must come here himself, unarmed and alone. Only if the king walks to the top of this mountain on his own two feet will I even consider curing him," the sage declared.

Under normal circumstances, neither the king nor the queen would have paid any heed to such demands. In fact, they would have likely had the sage executed as well. But the king's headache had become so unbearable that they were forced to accept the condition. With great difficulty, the king climbed to the top of the mountain, where the sage's ashram stood. Exhausted by anger, sorrow, and thirst, the king finally encountered the mysterious sage. The sight of the meditating sage instantly melted away the king's fury.

The king was captivated by the serene light emanating from the sage's head. The sage opened his eyes and handed the king a vessel of pure water, which, upon drinking, restored the king's vitality. Afterward, the king sat in tranquility, and the sage began to speak:

"King, listen carefully. As long as I speak, you will keep your eyes closed and breathe slowly."

"This illness of yours is not a physical ailment; it is the result of your actions from a past life. The accounts of your previous existence are yet to be settled, which is why you are facing such torment."

"Long, long ago, in a northern kingdom, you were born as a dog. In a village of that kingdom lived a remarkably beautiful girl named Nirang. Even as a dog, you were captivated by her beauty—you fell in love with her. Wherever she went, you followed her. Your task was to roam around her, trailing behind. Nirang cared for you too; she brought you home, fed you, and took care of you. There was no lack of kindness in her heart. Everyone around you was also madly in love with Nirang's beauty. Seeing you, they burned with jealousy, thinking, 'Ah\! If only I could be that dog\!' Nirang, however, was unfazed by all this. She went about her daily chores, roamed the forests, bathed in the spring water, and spent her days with you. This led to whispers around the village, questioning whether Nirang had indeed married that dog. What began as a joke gradually made it increasingly difficult for Nirang to step outside her home. Whenever anyone saw her, they would point and say, 'The dog’s wife\!' And you were with her every single day of the week. As Nirang heard these comments, her feelings began to change. She felt affection for you, but at the same time, she grew angry. It was because of you that her once free life had become a prison\! One day, Nirang devised a plan to free herself from you, no matter what it took. She could not bear living in such a pathetic state, being labeled as the 'dog’s wife.'"

The sage paused, and the king opened his eyes. The sage spoke to him:

"Drink another cup of water. Do you wish to know how Nirang freed herself from you? Do you wonder why your headache worsens every autumn and winter? Then sit calmly."

The sage began to speak once more.

"To escape the shame of being called the 'dog's wife,' Nirang took you to the place where she first found you. But it was in vain; you still managed to find your way back to her home. Then she thought that if she took you far away from the village, perhaps you wouldn't be able to find your way back. So, Nirang led you along a mountain path, winding through rocky crevices. "But you were no less clever. You left your tracks along the way. The day after she abandoned you deep in the forest, you followed those marks back to Nirang's home. The villagers did not stop their cruel gossip about Nirang. Her behavior towards you also became quite harsh, but you were just a dog—so it didn't affect you much. "One night, after scolding you, she lovingly fed you the next day, and you were happy again. On one such morning, Nirang took you up to the highest peak of the mountains. She ran ahead and, upon reaching, stretched out her arms to call you. You joyfully sprinted upwards. Just then, Nirang quickly stepped aside. You ran forward and crashed hard against a solid rock. You started rolling down the mountainside, and tears filled Nirang's eyes. She never wished for such a fate for you, but there was no easier way for her. This desolate place at the mountain peak saw no one else, and here was where she could finally be free of you. Many, many years have passed since then. In the place where you died, there stood a peculiar tree. A wicked witch lived in that tree, whose sole purpose was to capture the souls of whoever she could find, be it human or dog. Those souls were her toys. Whenever she pleased, she would take them out of her pouch and play with them. Your soul is still with that witch. Years have gone by, and you have transformed from a dog into a king. Yet, your soul has not found its freedom. Thus, whenever the witch pulls your soul from the pouch, that is when your headache begins."

The king listened in silence for a long time. After the story ended, he was so astonished that he could not speak at first. His soul captured by a wicked witch? Where was that tree? What was the solution to this? A myriad of questions began swirling in the king's mind. In an instant, he forgot the serene demeanor of the ascetic and shouted in anger, “Ascetic\! You must find a solution to this, no matter what. Otherwise, your head will roll\!” The king fumed with rage. The ascetic smiled faintly and replied that it was his duty to pray for the patient's recovery. He would fulfill his responsibility.

But how? First, the queen and all the ministers present were convinced and sent back to the palace. Then, the king and the ascetic sat down to devise a plan. Together with a trusted sailor of the king, they set off for the northern land—where the king's soul was imprisoned.

At the beginning of their journey, the ascetic warned the king:

“If you encounter any river or body of water, never spit there. And under no circumstances should you disrespect anyone.” But the king was not one to heed advice easily. He disobeyed the warning, and of course, faced a fitting punishment. That is another story.

In fact, the king loved to chew betel leaves. As soon as he got on the boat, he started munching on them. The further the boat moved, the more the waves grew. Amidst one of those waves, the king spat out his betel juice. That reddish-colored spit landed beneath the water, in an underwater kingdom. The princess of that kingdom was sitting and sewing at the time. When the king's spit touched her thread, she was delighted by the red hue. Immediately, she went to her father and insisted, “I want to tame the creature that produced this beautiful red color\!”

Meanwhile, the small group of the king, the ascetic, and the sailor arrived at the riverbank, at the edge of the forest. It was a steep path leading into the woods. At the beginning of the forest stood a tall tree with a small house perched at its top. They climbed the steep path and, upon entering the house, felt as if they had never seen such a maze before\! The king, in his usual harsh manner, shouted out loud. Hearing his shout, an incredibly beautiful woman emerged. Though she wasn't initially very pleased to see them, after listening to their story, she agreed to help them. She spared no effort in her hospitality. After dinner that night, when the king asked for her name, she replied, “People call me Nirang.”

"This is the name\! This is the woman\!" The king's eyes lit up as he looked at Nirang. Even now, he thought there was no one with more beautiful eyes in the world. Recognizing Nirang, he shared everything the ascetic had told him. Nirang informed him, "The path to liberation is right ahead."

The next day, everyone set off toward the mountaintop, where the witch's tree stood tall and seemed to stretch endlessly into the sky. There were many stories about the witch. It was said that she carried a large pouch and roamed the forests with it. As they entered the witch's territory in the woods, they heard her booming laughter echoing through the air. Upon hearing the laughter, they went to the riverbank, where they spotted the witch. Nirang had a prior acquaintance with her, as she also possessed some magical spells. Looking at her, Nirang said, "You seem very happy\!"

The witch replied, "Why shouldn't I be happy? I've heard from far away that you are coming." With that, the witch bared her sharp teeth and looked at them. The shadow of her thick black hair seemed to envelop the surroundings in darkness. The witch demanded the king's life from Nirang, but the witch would not return the soul so easily.

Nirang was not one to back down either. Thus began an epic battle of magic between the two. One would cast a spell, only for the other to counter it with another spell. After a long struggle, the witch finally conceded. However, she agreed to return the king's soul only on one condition.

“I can return your king’s soul on one condition: 

If he does not wish to return when he takes the path back.”

Once they leave this forest, they must never look back, that is the only condition. The king always found it rather strange to hear such terms. Taking back his soul, the king bid farewell to Nirang and the jungle and set off on his way with the ascetic and the sailor.

But that river, and the kingdom beneath its surface—there had already been a decree issued in the name of the king. The princess was seeking a new pet, one that possessed the red thread of weaving\!

As the boat floated on the river, it drifted for a while before the king turned back and saw a huge wave rushing toward him. He realized that there was no escape from his fate. The massive wave swept him away, and he became the princess's pet “dog” in the watery realm.

Meanwhile, everyone threw the queen into the dungeon. The people of the kingdom, now without their king and queen, began to thrive in happiness. After all, no one wanted such a wicked king and queen\!

# **The girl who lived in a seashell**

[https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/the-girl-who-lived-in-a-seashell](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/the-girl-who-lived-in-a-seashell) 

It was a long time ago. In a corner of the village lived a young orphan named Sushil. Though his father had passed away when he was very young, his mother had only left him a few days ago. Since then, Sushil had neither cared to bathe nor eat. His home, too, had fallen into disarray, with nothing in order.

Sushil would just lie in a corner of his house, reminiscing about the old days and his mother's love. When his mother was alive, he used to spend entire days collecting seashells by the shore. It's been so long since he last gathered shells—he had almost forgotten those days entirely.

After many such days had passed, one day the sun shone brightly, breaking through all the clouds. Sushil felt the desire to soak up some of that sunlight. As he wandered around in the warmth, his spirits unexpectedly lifted. And right then, his eyes caught sight of a strange and beautiful seashell. Seeing this shell, he didn’t feel like eating it, but rather, he wanted to keep it. So, carefully cradling the shell in his palm, Sushil took it home.

After wandering all day, a tired Sushil had fallen asleep. When he woke up in the middle of the night, he was astonished to see that his previously disordered home was no longer in disarray. Someone had carefully and neatly arranged everything. There it was—the pot of rice steaming away. Nearby, dishes were arranged, and a pan of curry was simmering as well.

Sushil rubbed his eyes, trying to make sure he wasn’t dreaming. There was no one else in the house but him. Who could have done all this? Though he couldn’t figure it out, he did understand one thing—he was absolutely starving. With the delightful smell of rice wafting through the air, how could anyone resist? That afternoon, Sushil enjoyed a hearty meal.However, Sushil made a plan in his mind. The next time, he would pretend to be asleep and stay in bed. After all, he needed to see who was turning his messy house into a palace, as if by magic\! 

The next day, Sushil lay completely still, making not a sound. As soon as he pretended to sleep, he saw a breathtakingly beautiful girl emerge from the shell of the snail he had found. The moment the girl quietly stepped out of the snail's shell, her radiant light transformed Sushil's shabby room into something resembling a palace.

As soon as the girl emerged from the shell, she first swept the room, then put rice on the stove, chopped fish, and cooked vegetables. After completing all the chores, just as she was about to return to the snail, Sushil suddenly rushed forward and grabbed her. "Who are you? Why are you secretly doing all the work in my house?" The girl remained completely silent.

She didn’t say a word. Her gaze was fixed on the shell of the snail lying in the corner of the room. Since the girl had come out, the shell no longer looked as beautiful as before. Sushil became very angry and kicked the shell out of the house. It shattered into pieces.

Immediately, the girl exclaimed, "What have you done? What have you done?"

"Now tell me, who are you?" Sushil asked.

"Alright, but let me go first. I can't return to the shell now."

Feeling embarrassed, Sushil released her and said, "Now tell me your story."

Then the girl began to narrate a strange curse and the tale of her past life.

"My name is Shamak Kanya. I can't even say how long I have been living inside this shell. When I was very young, a wicked sorcerer trapped me in this shell. Because of him, I lost my father, my mother, and my entire family. "The sorcerer had cursed me, saying that I couldn't stay outside this shell for long. However, he also mentioned a way out: if ever a human were to break this shell, I would be freed. Today, you inadvertently did just that. You have liberated me from the sorcerer's curse. I will stay with you from now on."

Hearing the words of the Shell Princess, Sushil felt as if he had found the moon in his hands. She took him to a strange and enchanting place.

It is a kingdom where there are no people anywhere around. Only the damp earth stretches out, scattered with countless shells. The Shell Princess walked forward with a sweet smile and, placing her hand on one of the shells, it transformed into a human. Then, one by one, more people emerged from the shells. Sushil learned from the Shell Princess that they were all subjects of this kingdom. The Shell Princess was indeed the princess of this realm.

In an instant, a slumbering kingdom awakened. From the shells emerged a vast sea of people. The Shell Princess joyfully danced her way into the royal palace, the very place from which she had been banished by the sorcerer's curse. Sushil followed closely behind her. Inside the palace, many more shells were scattered about.

One by one, the Shell Princess's parents, the King and Queen, awoke, along with their attendants, guards, and soldiers. After so long, reuniting with their daughter and reclaiming their lives filled the King and Queen with overwhelming joy. Without hesitation, they welcomed Sushil as their son-in-law.

The next day, the old King announced, "From today, Sushil shall be the king of this realm." The unfortunate Sushil, now crowned, began to rule the kingdom alongside the Shell Princess. No wicked sorcerer ever dared to set foot in their kingdom again.

# **Kolaboti Konna**

[https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/kolaboti-konna](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/kolaboti-konna)

Narayan was the ruler of the Teylafang region in the Tripura kingdom. He had five sons, of which the wives of four were very beautiful and attractive. The youngest prince was unmarried and was the beloved younger brother of the four sisters-in-law. One day, the sisters-in-law joked, “No girl will ever come to the house of the lazy prince.” The youngest prince replied, “Just watch; my wife will be more beautiful than all of you.” Saying this, he set out to find a bride, carrying a branch of the gumchak fruit (a sweet and fragrant wild fruit that resembles an apple), a stick, and a knife.

While walking, the prince's eyes fell upon an exquisite girl in a bamboo hut, adorned with a rinai (traditional garment). She had wildflowers woven into her hair and was wearing various ornaments while spinning thread on a charka (spinning wheel). He approached the hut and addressed her:

“O beautiful one,  

I am a traveler; will you give me some water?  

In return for quenching my thirst,  

You shall receive a reward of virtue.”

Girl: "Wow\! What kind of talk is this? Why wouldn't I give you water? Come up the stairs and sit." Saying this, the girl laughed lightly and went inside the bamboo hut. But the prince noticed that although the girl was incredibly beautiful, all her teeth were eaten away by pests. This filled his heart with sorrow. He set out again on an unknown path.

After some time, he arrived at a different village. There, he saw a young girl filling a pitcher with water from a small spring. The girl, adorned with silver ornaments, was extremely beautiful. The prince became a guest at her house. He shared his feelings with the girl's father. Upon hearing his words, the family was delighted. They dressed up the girl and brought her out. However, the prince noticed that her eyes were cross-eyed. The next day, he took his leave from there.

The young prince vowed that he would not return home without a beautiful bride. Suddenly, he spotted a small hut in the middle of a banana grove. There, a very beautiful girl was walking about. The young prince froze in place. The girl, too, was startled and looked up. She seemed like a celestial nymph from heaven. When the young prince called out to her, she disappeared into a garden of flowers. The young prince could no longer see her.

Then he went to the house at the end of the garden and said, "I am a weary traveler. I wish to be your guest. I will leave tomorrow at dawn." Saying this, he handed his belongings to the house owner and began to rest.

In the morning, the young prince woke up to find that the household members had ruined his belongings. Then he proposed to marry the beautiful girl in exchange for his things. They handed him a banana stem and said, "This is our only daughter; her name is Kolaboti. But be cautious\! Do not open her petals until you have crossed three springs. If you do, there will be trouble."

“Banana stem holds the girl,  

Her name is Kolaboti.  

Beware of danger,  

Until you cross three springs\!”

Taking the banana stem from the householder, the young prince set off towards home. As he traveled, his curiosity grew. Before he could cross the three springs, he stopped in the shade of a banyan tree and opened one of the petals of the banana stem. Indeed, hidden within was the girl Kolaboti. The radiance of her beauty lit up the surroundings. She said she was very thirsty. 

The prince, leaving Kolaboti beneath the tree, went down to the spring to fetch her some water. Little did he know that a wicked witch lived in that banyan tree, and she too had seen Kolaboti.

As soon as the young prince left, the witch climbed down from the tree and devoured Kolaboti. Then, using her magic, she assumed Kolaboti's beautiful form and hid herself within the banana stem. 

The young prince returned with water in a bamboo tube and carefully fed it to the witch, who was disguised as Kolaboti. He brought her home, completely unaware of the deception that had taken place.

As soon as the young prince arrived home, he showed everyone his bride. The house shimmered with her beauty. However, it wasn't long before trouble began. The new bride emitted a terrible odor, cursed at everyone, and refused to socialize with anyone.

Seeing this, the prince's father decided to build a separate house for the young couple. There, the prince noticed that his bride had an insatiable appetite, only wanting to eat meat. She preferred her food almost raw, cooked without any oil or spices. The young prince began to wither away in worry, feeling increasingly troubled by her strange behavior.

One day, the young prince dreamt that the water from the spring, which Kolabati had drunk, called him with two golden fish. The next day, he went to the spring and, to his surprise, saw two golden fish swimming there. The young prince gently caressed the fish.

Meanwhile, the witch had been watching the prince. She begged him to catch the two golden fish for her. The prince drained the water from the spring and managed to catch the golden fish. The witch then roasted the fish over the fire, making delicious skewers. She enjoyed one fish while forcing the other upon the young prince. However, he couldn't bring himself to eat it. Instead, he dug a hole in the courtyard and buried the fish there.

One day, the young prince noticed that from the hole where he had buried the fish, a bottle gourd vine had begun to grow. He cut bamboo from the forest and made a fence around it. The gourd plant flourished and eventually climbed up to the roof, producing a beautiful gourd that hung above the entrance to his home. 

However, whenever the disguised witch passed beneath it, the gourd would drop and hit her on the head, causing her great pain. The young prince found this immensely amusing. He had instructed everyone not to pick the gourd, keeping it safe to continue the witch's mischief.

The witch, disguised as the bride, became suspicious of the gourd. To uncover its true nature, she insisted on visiting her father's house to check it in a mirror. Upon the young prince's agreement, she left the next day. 

As soon as she departed, the prince's heart filled with joy. He took the gourd and carefully placed it in the corner of the bedroom, where it would be safe and out of sight.

The next day, the prince woke up to find everything in his room neatly arranged. When he went to the kitchen, he saw that the pots and pans were washed and cleaned, and food was being prepared. Confused about who could have done all this, he searched for answers but found none.

The following night, he decided to leave everything in disarray before going to bed. He pretended to be asleep while actually staying awake. In the middle of the night, he witnessed something astonishing: a beautiful maiden emerged from the gourd.

The prince realized that this was his wife. But if she had gone to her father's house, then who was this girl? He remained silent, pretending to be asleep on the bed. Meanwhile, the beautiful maiden began sweeping the room. Quietly, he crept up from behind and grabbed her.

The gourd maiden exclaimed in surprise, "Oh\! What are you doing?" When the prince asked for her identity, she revealed everything to him.

She said, “When you left me under the banyan tree to fetch water from the spring, the old witch who lived in the tree found me alone and devoured me. She left behind my two fingers. When she saw you coming back with water, the witch threw those two fingers into the spring and disguised herself as me. After that, I appeared to you in your dreams, leading you to the spring. I would play with you as a golden fish. But the old witch suspected you and made a roasted dish out of me. Because you buried my remains in the yard instead of eating them, I was reborn as a gourd. The old witch, still suspicious of me, went to your father's house to look in the magic mirror. If you want to have me back, you must kill the old witch. But I warn you: do not strike her on land, for even a drop of her blood will give birth to another witch. The old witch must be killed in the water of the spring. The water is filled with countless little frogs. But they are not just frogs; they are the various animals and birds of the forest. When the witch hunted humans and drank their blood, these creatures would cry out, 'We will testify, we will testify.' Angered by their defiance, the witch used her magic to transform them into frogs. As soon as the frogs drink the witch's blood, the magic will be broken, and they will return to their true forms. If even a drop of the witch's blood splashes on the gourd, I will be reborn as Kolaboti once more. Until then, you won't be able to have me." With this, Kolaboti transformed back into a gourd.”

Hearing Kolaboti's words, the young prince ran to his father's house and brought back a knife. The next morning, when the old witch arrived and noticed the gourd was missing, she asked the prince, "Where has our gourd gone?"

The young prince replied, "I've kept the gourd aside for you. You can cook it with some small fish."

With that, the prince led the witch to the spring. Pretending to fish, he searched for an opportunity to strike the witch down.

But the opportunity never came. Just as he was about to strike, the witch suddenly shouted, "Hey\! Why are you raising that knife against me?"

The young prince replied, "Oh, it’s nothing. A fly was buzzing over your head, and I was just trying to shoo it away." 

This way, the young prince's patience finally wore thin. He swiftly swung the knife and struck the witch on the neck. Instantly, the witch screamed, shaking the very air with her cries, and dashed towards the shore. The frogs in the spring shouted, "Young prince, grab her and throw her into the water\!"

"Don't let her get to the shore\!" The young prince seized the witch and struck her repeatedly with the knife, throwing her into the spring. The frogs came in droves, sucking the witch's blood and freeing themselves from the spell, transforming back into various birds like magpies, doves, and mynas. Some even turned into rabbits, jackals, badgers, and deer, fleeing back into the forest.

A drop of the witch's blood had landed on the young prince's knife. As soon as he sprinkled that blood onto the gourd, the true form of Kolaboti appeared, embracing the young prince. His heart filled with joy. From then on, they all lived together in happiness and peace.

**The girl who lived inside a pineapple**

[The girl who lived inside a pineapple](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/the-girl-who-lived-inside-a-pineapple)

In the city of Bairat, there was a prince named Emran. One night, he dreamed of a girl of unmatched beauty. Since then, he lost all desire for food and sleep—the melody of her presence played endlessly in his mind. But finding this girl was no easy task, for she did not reside in any ordinary palace. She lived far away, within a pineapple. Inside the core of the pineapple was a vast palace, and the girl was surrounded by fourteen layers of curtains.

Anwar Kali, the maiden with hair so long it trails upon the ground, captivates everyone who sees her—they fall to the earth in awe. Yet, no one can approach her, for each layer of curtain surrounding her is guarded differently. Breaking through these walls of protection to reach Anwar Kali is nearly impossible.

People say that even animals, birds, or a single gust of wind cannot enter that dark palace. And it’s not just the maiden herself—her maids, each as beautiful as heavenly houris, guard her every step.

Their anklets chime with gold threads so fine,

Each maid like an angel, guarding in fourfold lines. 

Four paths, five maids, 

Each radiant, as if no earthly beauty could compare.

Thinking day and night of that strange maiden in the mysterious palace, Emran eventually left everything behind—his home, his land—and wandered aimlessly, lost in her thoughts. Moving like a madman, he traveled from country to country, until one day, his steps took him to the kingdom of Eran, ruled by King Bhanu Udas. Bhanu Udas had a daughter, a princess of great renown.

The princess’s gaze fell upon Emran, and she was immediately taken by him. Little did anyone know, this princess had never married; she spent her days secluded in her chambers, practicing magic and spells. She was so captivated by Emran that she cast a spell by the riverbank, trapping him within a \*kadam\* flower in her hair bun. Thus, a few days passed in this enchanted state.

The princess would gently sway the \*kadam\* flower, laughing joyfully as she did. Over by the river’s stone-paved bank, a clever crow named Dhal Kauwa would often fly about. Noticing the princess’s unusual laughter, Dhal Kauwa sensed that something was amiss\! So, one day, he swooped down and deftly snatched the enchanted \*kadam\* flower from the princess's hair.

Losing Emran, the princess became frantic with sorrow. She pleaded with the king, her father, saying he must somehow catch that crow. King Bhanu Udas loved his daughter dearly, treasuring her like no other. Seeing his beloved daughter so distressed, he sent messengers throughout the kingdom with a royal proclamation:

"From the king, a stern decree,  

Hear ye all, from far and near—  

A command to slay the crow,  

The king has given, loud and clear\!"

The proclamation echoed far and wide: anyone failing to kill the crow would be impaled. The entire kingdom trembled in fear, and people rushed out in search of the crow. 

Even the sharp-eared crow, Dhal Kauwa, heard the warning beat of the messenger’s drum. Ever since, he had been flying non-stop, carrying the enchanted kadam flower with him.

No rest in sight, for wherever he went, people awaited him with weapons raised. Some threw stones, others swung brooms, trying to hit him. But Dhal Kauwa stayed just out of reach, flying high above them all. Furious with frustration, the king ordered his entire kingdom impaled—no one was spared. 

The crow continued his flight, gliding over the land of terror-stricken people, still carrying the enchanted kadam flower. In that moment, the king's senses returned, and he lamented:

"Oh dear, what madness have I wrought

In search of a single crow\!

This kingdom, now devoid of subjects,

How can I remain here alone?"

Seeing the princess, the king became even more enraged. He couldn't comprehend why his daughter was so distressed over a mere crow:

"Why, my daughter, have you wandered

To that riverbank over there?

What madness possesses you,

That a single crow drives you to despair?"

As the king tried to pull at the princess's hair, she ran out of the palace. She could no longer stay in that palace. At that moment, she encountered the fugitive crow. Seeing the crow, tears welled up in the princess's eyes; her beloved Shah Emran was right there\! The crow felt a twinge of pity.

The crow spread its wings and offered shelter to the princess. Even when the king came searching, the crow did not reveal any information about the princess. Riding on the back of the crow, the princess escaped the land.

"Fearing death, the princess  

Climbed onto the crow's back.  

With the wind, the crow  

Soared away."

For six years, the crow flew on, carrying the enchanted princess on its back. After six years, they arrived at the land of the pineapple. There, the crow said to the princess, “The heart of the one you love, Emiron, belongs to another. He loves the beautiful Anwar Koli Kanya, who lives inside the pineapple. If you take him to her, your Emiron will be happy." Upon hearing this, the princess's heart shattered.

But she agreed. The crow then guided her to the entrance of the pineapple palace,

"Seven thousand maidens keep watch over her inside.  

The princess resides within the pineapple,  

Dressed beautifully in finery,  

So you mustn't sleep or lay down,  

Among the maidens who stand guard\!"

Thus adorned, the princess wrapped herself in raw golden silk and wore jingling anklets on her feet to become the handmaiden of the pineapple princess. The clever crow gave her a special potion that, when sprinkled, would put all the guards to sleep.

After seven days of sleep, when they awoke, they found that all the curtains had been cut away, and the pineapple palace was completely free\! No one knew that the princess of Eran had come to this palace with the help of the clever crow. Before leaving, she had entrusted her beloved Emran to the pineapple princess.

They were both happy together, but seeing Emran with the princess, the general thought, "This must be the real culprit\!" Without listening to any further words, he killed Emran right then and there. Emran's lifeless body lay on the floor of the pineapple palace.

In hand was a gun,  

With bullets loaded,  

He aimed and shot,  

And Emran fell dead.

After Emran's death, the princess of the pineapple was stunned. She couldn't comprehend what had just happened. This beautiful prince had brought joy into her dark life, and now he was gone\! Overwhelmed by sorrow, she tore a piece from her saree and sat down to write a letter. Whispering into the wind, she said, "Deliver this to the wise crow."

She had written ten lines in the letter, but what a cruel twist of fate\! Only one line reached the crow: the news that Emran was no more. Alas, no one knew who the wise crow truly was. In reality, the wise crow was also the daughter of a general, named Zarina.

Zarina had been living in Emran's kingdom all along. She had liked Emran since childhood but could never express it. When the princess of Eran had trapped him with her magic in a kadam flower, she had taken the form of a crow to rescue him\! Upon receiving the letter, Zarina fell to the ground and vowed:

"Oh, pineapple princess,  

What have you awakened in me?  

I will tear apart your fourteen petals  

With the power of my feet."

After that, the magical daughter Zarina would sometimes take the form of a crow and sometimes the form of a snake, racing back and forth to the land of the pineapple. Finally, in the guise of a human, she tied the pineapple in her sari and fled. Then, one by one, she unleashed fire arrows and burned the pineapple palace to ashes.

Before burning down the entire country, she went into the captain's house and rescued the pineapple girl with her left hand. There, she found Emran's body sprawled on the floor. She carefully tied him up in her sari and took him to the enchanted garden. There was a magical spring named Ab Hayat, whose water could revive the dead when sprinkled on them.

As the water of Ab Hayat was sprinkled, 

By God's command, 

Shah Emran rose and sat up. 

Then, taking on the form of the shield crow, Zarina flew into the sky with the pineapple girl and Emran on her back.

Meanwhile, tied in the hem of her garment was the pineapple palace. After flying for six months, they finally reached their own kingdom. There, she shed her form of the crow.

Emran recognized her as the daughter of the general\!

Zarina, golden sand,

Her name became known as Yaar.

Seeing Zarina, Emran realized everything—the pain in Zarina's heart. But his mind was still painted with the image of that pineapple maiden. "Where is Zarina, where is my pineapple princess?"

Then Zarina revealed everything to him: "I've loved you since childhood. But the day you left your home in search of the pineapple maiden, I looked into the fate and saw that your destiny was tied to hers. So, I went to find her for you. The pain in my heart is too much to describe. Just keep me as your servant, and my life will be complete."

Hearing all this, Emran's heart softened. He immediately called for a kazi and married Zarina. Then, he went to the garden and cut open the pineapple to release the pineapple maiden.

From that day forward, Emran became the king of the land, with Queen Pineapple Maiden by his side, and the clever crow, now in the form of Zarina, served as a maid in the palace. But is there always a happy ending for everyone in stories?

**The tale of Alal and Dulal**

[The tale of Alal and Dulal](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/the-tale-of-alaal-and-dulal)

The Dewan of Boinnachong, Sonafar, sits beside his dying wife, accompanied by his two sons, Alal and Dulal. On her deathbed, Sonafar's wife requests that he never remarry after her passing. She believes that a stepmother can never truly love her stepchildren. Therefore, with the sky, the air, and all the animals and birds as witnesses, she makes this vow to her husband before taking her last breath.

Meanwhile, after their mother’s death, Alal and Dulal stop eating due to their grief. Sonafar is also struggling to accept that his wife is gone. Seeing his sons in such distress deeply worries him. Gradually, Sonafar loses focus on his duties as Dewan, and his absence begins to affect the administration negatively. Observing this, his ministers and officials come together to request that he remarry. Sonafar responds that if he takes another wife, she might not care for his children properly, as a stepmother can never truly be a loving parent.

The minister said, “Not all stepmothers are the same, and we are here to support you.” Sonafar thought to himself that if he neglects his duties as Dewan, he would face even more problems in the future. After much consideration, he agreed to remarry, but secretly decided to keep Alal and Dulal close to him, ensuring that the stepmother would have no power to harm them. 

After the marriage, Sonafar always kept Alal and Dulal by his side, even taking them with him to the Dewan's office. He never left them in the care of his second wife. Seeing this, Sonafar's new wife began to burn with jealousy. She thought that until she removed this thorn of a stepson, she would never be truly happy.

So, one day she pretended to cry and began sobbing. Seeing her sorrowful demeanor, Sonafar asked, “What’s wrong, my new wife? What sorrow weighs on your heart?” She replied that Alal and Dulal were also her children, but Sonafar did not allow them to come to her simply because she was their stepmother. She went on to say that not all stepmothers are the same, and her heart ached for the children. She claimed that facing death would be better than enduring such humiliation. 

Seeing her state, Sonafar's heart softened, and he assured her that from now on, he would allow Alal and Dulal to come to her.

After Sonafar left, the second wife thought about how to win Alal and Dulal's trust. Therefore, she spent the entire night decorating the inner chambers and cooking delicious meals. The next morning, when Sonafar brought Alal and Dulal to her, his wife embraced them warmly and showered them with kisses all over their faces. She lovingly fed them with her own hands throughout the day. Receiving such affection, Alal and Dulal no longer wanted to go back with their father.

Days went by, and the stepmother continued her act of love while secretly plotting to remove the thorn of Alal and Dulal from her path. Sonafar was completely oblivious to all this. He believed that his children were well-cared for and, as a result, focused on his duties as a chief. He no longer worried about them. But little did he know the wicked schemes his own wife was concocting. No one had any idea of her true intentions.

It was the month of Shravan, and boat racing was taking place. When the stepmother proposed to take Alal and Dulal to watch the boat race, they eagerly agreed. However, her true intention was to take the boys out on the water under the pretense of watching the race and then drown them in the deep water. To carry out this sinister plan, she informed a local executioner, promising him a reward of "twenty bighas of land and a house" in exchange for his assistance in her wicked scheme.

They both crafted a beautiful peacock-feathered boat and dressed up Alal and Dulal before sending them off with the executioner. As the exquisite boat drifted to the middle of the river, the executioner revealed his true self and threatened the boys.

"Remember the name of Allah before your time of death.  

I am the one who stands at the door of your fate.  

In my hands, two of you will meet your end;  

I will strike you down and then drown you in the river."

Alal and Dulal, poor boys, were terrified upon seeing the executioner's true form. When they heard of their stepmother's deceit, they broke down in tears. Alal loved his brother dearly and pleaded with the executioner, “Please spare Dulal and kill me instead.” Not to be outdone, Dulal made the same request. 

Witnessing such profound love between the two brothers, even the stone-hearted executioner was moved. He abandoned his intentions to harm them and instead transferred them to a merchant's boat that was passing by, adorned with twelve oars. He said, “May you be well, my boys. Save yourselves and go on your way.”

The merchant, heading to the village of Kajol Kanda to buy rice, ended up selling Alal and Dulal instead, without purchasing any rice. The brothers struggled daily, going hungry and suffering greatly. One day, the elder brother Alal managed to escape, but Dulal stayed behind at the merchant's house.

In the region of Dhanuk, near the riverbank and among twelve jungles and thirteen lands, there lived a certain Dewan named Sekander, who was passionate about bird hunting. One day, while hunting, he spotted Alal beneath a tree. Delighted by the sight, Sekander took him home with him. 

Alal began working there without any pay. When asked about a salary, he replied, “I won't take anything now. I will claim my wages later.” His work impressed everyone, including Sekander.

Dewan Sekander had no sons; instead, he had two exceptionally beautiful daughters, Momina and Amina. He began to see Alal as his own son and wished to marry one of his daughters to him. However, whenever Sekander inquired about Alal's lineage, he would fall completely silent. Because of this, Sekander lost much of his enthusiasm for arranging a marriage.

In this way, twelve years passed by. Now, Alal decided to ask for all his wages at once. Dewan Sekander was very surprised and asked, "What do you plan to do with such a large sum of money, Alal?" Alal informed him that he wanted to establish a home in a town called Banyachang. Instead of wages, he requested 500 workers and 200 soldiers so that he could wage war against Dewan Sonafar and reclaim his home. Sekander agreed to his request and provided him with everything he demanded.

Meanwhile, Sonafar had long passed away by that time. He had died a long time ago, grieving the loss of his two sons. Before his death, his second wife had given birth to a son, and that boy was now the Dewan of Banyachang. However, his ministers and officials were not very competent, and as a result, the administration of Banyachang had declined significantly, almost falling into ruin.

Alal then assigned 500 laborers to construct the house and stationed 200 soldiers to guard the surrounding land. This news spread throughout Banyachang. The local minister approached Alal, seeking to impose taxes. However, Alal refused to pay any taxes, asserting that he had come to build a home on his father's land. Hearing this, a battle broke out between Banyachang's forces and Alal's troops. Ultimately, Alal emerged victorious. In fear of defeat, Sonafar's second wife, Alal and Dulal's stepmother, fled that very night, abandoning everything.

Leaving the Dewan’s house, Alal disguised himself to search for Dulal. After a long search without finding his brother, he finally rested under a banyan tree, exhausted. Just then, a group of shepherds passed by, singing a song. Fate worked in mysterious ways, for the song was a lament about Alal and Dulal’s story—a tale of Dulal's sorrow after Alal had left. Hearing this song, Alal found a clue about his brother’s whereabouts:

“The one who taught us this song  

Hasn’t come today to graze the cows,  

He stays in that farmer’s house,  

To find him, follow this path.”

Alal invited Dulal to come with him to Bynyachong, but Dulal explained that he was married to a woman named Madina and had a son named Surat Jamal. He didn’t want to leave his wife and child behind. Alal, however, advised him otherwise, suggesting that he divorce Madina and marry someone of their own family’s lineage to uphold their ancestral honor and continue the Dewani legacy. Considering his family’s legacy and the responsibilities of their estate, Dulal made a harsh decision. Without even meeting Madina, he wrote a letter of divorce and left it with her brother.

After this, the two brothers returned to Bynyachong and married Dewan Sekander's two daughters—Alal to Amina and Dulal to Momina. Together, they settled into their new lives, and for a time, everything went well.

Madina received the divorce letter and laughed, thinking Dulal might be joking. She loved Dulal so deeply that she couldn’t accept this as the truth. Believing he would return someday, she prepared various dishes and stored them carefully, dreaming of the day she could serve them to her husband.

"Today or tomorrow, he’ll surely come," she thought,  

And so Madina, beautiful Madina, spent countless nights waiting.  

Today she prepared sweets from palm sap, tomorrow she made puffed rice,  

Storing them in baskets, binding curd with cloths tight and nice.  

Rice flakes from fine Shail paddy she’d prepared with great care,  

Filling jars and setting them high, in hope he’d return to share.

But Dulal never returned. Six long months passed, yet Madina held on to hope, thinking that at least the sight of his son, Surat-Jamal, might stir Dulal’s heart and bring him back. Her son was the light of her life. With this in mind, Madina sent Surat-Jamal to Bainyachong with her brother.

When they reached Bainyachong, they managed to find Dulal. However, instead of welcoming them, Dulal coldly told them to leave. He warned that no one in this region knew about them, and if anyone found out, it would bring him great shame and trouble in his new life. Dulal made it clear—they were not to set foot in Bainyachong again.

Hearing Dulal’s harsh words, Madina’s heart shattered, and she wept endlessly. She became “Deewana Madina,” lost in a trance of grief and longing. The memories of their days together haunted her, driving her nearly mad with sorrow. Day by day, weakened by the pain of separation, she withered away until finally, one day, she passed into the embrace of death. It was as though no one remained for her son, Surat-Jamal, and she had left him alone in this world. Madina was laid to rest in a grave near her home, marking the end of her sorrowful journey.

Even though Dulal had sent Madina and his son away with harsh words, a deep sadness lingered in his heart. Regret consumed him, and, without telling anyone, he fled from Bainyachong. He walked along the path to Kuzkanda, each step bringing back memories of the days he had left behind. Along the way, ominous signs appeared—crows cawed, kites cried. In the distance, he noticed Madina’s favorite cow, frail and weak, as if waiting for him. A sense of dread filled his heart. Rushing back home, Dulal found that his beloved Madina was no more; she had passed away in grief over him.

Dulal fell to his knees by Madina’s grave, weeping with a heart-wrenching cry. He begged for forgiveness from his dearest wife, the one he had abandoned over misguided thoughts.

“Oh, my beloved Madina, rise and speak to me,  

Never again will I cause pain in your heart.  

If only you would look my way one last time,  

I would never let you be parted from my chest.”  

Even though Alal came to bring him back, Dulal no longer wished to return to Bainyachong. He realized that the heart’s affection was the truest wealth, far more valuable than gold or jewels. With this understanding, Dulal built a small home beside Madina’s grave, where he remained, waiting for the end of his days.  

“Dulal became a fakir, abandoning his life as a noble,  

No longer did he seek the path to Bainyachong.  

He counted his final days by Madina’s resting place,  

His grief so deep that even stones wept water,  

And Jalal sang songs of sorrow and lament.”

**The prince who lived in the kitchen**

[The prince who lived in the kitchen](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/the-prince-who-lived-in-the-kitchen)

Several hundred years ago, there was a king named Ammok. The king had seven sons, but the youngest son was different from the rest. He would remain quiet all day and engage in cooking like the girls. Because of this, he was named 'Pahailya.' After years of enduring humiliation from the king, one day, out of deep resentment, he left the kingdom.

Walking along the path, Pahailya arrived in a forest where he saw a small hut and a goat tied up in front of it. He decided to spend the night there and, after having his dinner, he fell asleep. In the morning, Pahailya woke up to find his horse missing. Seeing no one else around, he became suspicious of the goat. The next night, he kept a close watch on the goat’s movements, and as he had suspected, once the night grew deep, the goat shed its disguise and transformed into a demoness. Witnessing this, Pahailya ran into the forest, but the demoness, now in the form of a young woman, chased after him.

Pahailya eventually arrived at the palace of a king. He pleaded with the king, saying, “Please protect me\! This girl has come to ruin my life.” The girl, however, declared, “Your Majesty\! He is my husband. He left home and abandoned me. I want him back.” The king then turned to Pahailya and said, “If you do not wish to be with this girl, give her up for 1,000 coins, and I will marry her.” Pahailya agreed, accepted the coins, and left, making his way to the house of a helpless old woman in that kingdom.

From that day, the demoness stayed in the form of a queen during the day and would transform at night, capturing and devouring the people of the kingdom. Fear spread throughout the land, and many residents fled in terror. Despite his best efforts, the king could not find a solution. When Pahailya heard about this, he approached the king and said, “I want to become your guard and confront this menace.” The king agreed to his proposal. From that night onward, Pahailya stood guard in front of the demoness queen’s quarters, sword in hand, ensuring she could not emerge and prey on anyone. As a result, the kingdom was protected, and the queen's health gradually began to deteriorate from the lack of human flesh.

To get rid of Pahailya, the demoness queen told the king, “In my homeland, there is a cow the size of a mouse that gives milk 7-8 times a day. If Pahailya retrieves this cow, I will no longer need to buy milk.” Hearing this, the king ordered Pahailya to fetch the cow. Obeying the command, Pahailya set off toward the demon city. Along the way, he met a dervish who, using his magic, transformed Pahailya into a crow. With wings spread wide, Pahailya flew to the land of demons and managed to bring back the extraordinary cow.

When Pahailya returned, the queen was once again troubled. Because Pahailya stood guard with his sword every night, she could not come out to devour the people. After several days of this, the queen approached the king once more and said, “In my homeland, there is a special grain of rice that, when sown, ripens in just one day. If we plant this rice in our kingdom, we will never face food shortages again.” The king, intrigued, ordered Pahailya to fetch the miraculous grain from the queen’s land. The queen then handed Pahailya a letter and said, “Deliver this to my mother.”

Pahailya left the kingdom once more, journeying toward the land of the demons. This time, he encountered an even more powerful hermit. The hermit had been meditating for eighteen years, and his body had become entwined with the roots of a tree. Pahailya explained everything to the hermit and showed him the letter given by the queen. The hermit opened the letter and found that it was written in the language of demons: "Mother, this young man is my greatest enemy. Because of him, I have been unable to hunt. As soon as you see him, kill him." The hermit used his magic to change the words in the letter and then sent Pahailya on his way. Once again, Pahailya took flight and arrived in the land of the demons. This time, he went straight to the mother of the demon queen and presented the letter. The letter now read, "Mother, this young man is your grandson. Take good care of him and show him where the rice seeds are."

Thus, Pahailya began living among the demons. One day, while exploring the northern side of the house, he discovered a pond whose waters were red, like blood. Upon returning home, he asked the demon queen's mother about the peculiar pond. At first, she tried to avoid the question with various excuses. But after much pleading and insistence, she finally revealed the truth: the demons bathed in that pond, and their sweat turned the water red.

When any of the demons faced danger, the color of the pond's water lilies would turn black. Conversely, when the lilies were white, it indicated that the demons were safe. In the center of the pond stood the king of the water lilies, a large flower. Beneath its root, buried in the soil, lay a small chest. Inside that chest was a bumblebee, which contained the souls of all the demons. One day, while the demons were out hunting, Pahailya cleverly retrieved the life-bumblebee from beneath the pond and flew back to his own kingdom as a bird.

Upon returning, Pahailya found that the demon queen had devoured half of the kingdom's subjects. He then informed the king to convene an urgent meeting at the royal court. When the meeting was called, Pahailya revealed the true form of the demon queen before everyone. After being exposed, the queen rushed at Pahailya to kill him. However, before she could do anything, Pahailya decapitated the bumblebee, killing the demoness. The king and everyone in the kingdom were very pleased with Pahailya, rewarding him with immense wealth and placing him in charge of the kingdom’s administration from the royal palace.

# **Husne Banu \- A Hatim Tai Tale**

[Husne Banu \- A Hatim Tai Tale](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/husne-banu-a-hatim-tai-tale)

Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Khorasan, there ruled a king named Khurdan Shah. He had five hundred thousand horses in his stables. In front of and behind the palace, there were ten thousand chariots along with a multitude of swordsmen, guards, and archers. People said that in his realm, even tigers and sheep drank water together, such was the justice of this king. Throughout the kingdom, only his fame and tales of compassion circulated from mouth to mouth among the people.

In this kingdom of Khorasan lived a merchant named Barzakh. The merchant lacked for nothing in wealth and riches. While he was not a king, he held himself with the same grandeur as one. He shared a close bond with Khurdan Shah. So, when the merchant passed away, he entrusted all the responsibilities of his beloved only daughter, Husne Banur, to the king. The king accepted her as if she were his own daughter.

Husne Banur was unmatched in beauty and talents. Everyone praised her for her knowledge and wit. After her father's death, the responsibility of the kingdom fell upon her shoulders. However, being a young woman, she was not short of suitors eager to marry her. Almost daily, she was harassed by a crowd of princes and merchant sons, leaving her no peace. Frustrated, Husne Banur approached her nursemaid and said, "Nurse, I do not want to marry right now. I wish to manage the business properly. What should I do?" The nurse then provided her with the clues to seven riddles and warned her that only if someone could solve all seven riddles should she accept him as a husband.

The seven riddles were as follows:

1\. Once you see someone, you desire to see them again and again.

2\. Do good deeds and throw them into the sea.

3\. As you sow, so shall you reap.

4\. Truth is peace.

5\. Bring news from the mountain that speaks, that is the Kohinor.

6\. I want a pearl as large as a duck's egg.

7\. Fate’s writing cannot be undone; is this true? Or does a person's labor also have value? (Alternatively, “Ask him to bring the calculation for the bath of the tailor\!”)

Husne Banu was having a difficult time with the seven riddles, as no one could solve them or complete the tasks she had given. One day, while looking out of the palace window, she saw a dervish. From a distance, the dervish appeared very kind and noble, so Husne Banu invited him into the palace. However, she was unaware of the true intentions of this dervish named Azrak. He was actually the leader of the forty thieves, and that very night, he planned to raid Husne Banu's palace and steal all her wealth. When Husne Banu later went to the king to seek justice, no one believed her. Even the king exiled her.

Overwhelmed with sorrow, Husne Banu set off on a journey deep into the forest with her nursemaid. Exhausted and heartbroken, they both wept under the shade of a grand tree until they fell into a deep sleep. In her dreams, an ethereal figure appeared to Husne Banu, radiating light and wisdom. He spoke to her, “Dear Husne Banu, the tree under which you rest holds the treasure of seven kingdoms\! It is yours to claim. Use this wealth to build a new city here, one that will bring prosperity and joy.”

Awakening from the dream, Husne Banu and her nursemaid, inspired by the vision, began digging under the tree with simple wooden sticks. To their astonishment, glittering jewels, gold, and treasures from seven palaces emerged from the earth. It was a bounty so abundant that it could sustain seven generations in luxury and comfort\!

Pieces of golden discs, jewel-encrusted chests, cups brimming with rubies and emeralds, and pearls as large as duck eggs—everything lay glittering before them\! Husne Banu did not disregard the divine command. She immediately sent her nursemaid to summon the kingdom’s finest blacksmiths, potters, and masons.

But to build a new city in the kingdom, she needed the king’s permission\! Who would bring that permission? The king had already misunderstood and banished her. Yet Husne Banu was not one to give up. Disguised as a merchant, with fists full of rubies and emeralds and a golden chest strapped to her horse, she set out. The determined youth strode straight into the king’s court. The king, seeing this newcomer, immediately inquired, “Who are you, young man? What do you seek in this kingdom?”

Husne Banu introduced herself as Mahru Shah, a foreign merchant. She presented gifts to the king and requested permission to stay at the house of Barzakh the merchant. The king, known for his generosity, hesitated briefly but eventually granted her request, saying, “Merchant, you should know that house is my son’s favorite\! But since you ask, go ahead and stay there.”

In that very court, disguised among the courtiers, was the bandit Azrak, still masquerading as a dervish. He had already looted Barzakh’s house once and never been caught. His tongue practically dripped with greed, and his eyes burned with the fire of desire. He thought, \*This merchant must be plundered too\!\* But little did Azrak know that Husne Banu was already plotting a trap for him, and it wouldn’t be long before he fell right into it\!

That very day, Mahru Shah (Husne Banu in disguise) invited the dervish and his forty disciples to the palace for a grand feast. While feasting, the dervish, Azrak, discreetly scoped out the merchant’s treasures, his mind swirling with schemes. \*Tonight, no matter what, everything must be seized\!\* he decided. Without delay, he returned home and shared every detail of the plan with his forty followers. Yet, little did Azrak know that at the same time, Mahru Shah was alerting her guards and making arrangements with the royal constable, preparing for whatever might come.

In the dead of night, Azrak and his forty thieves silently crept into Barzakh’s palace once more. But the moment Azrak slipped the ruby necklace from the goblet around his neck, the band of robbers found themselves surrounded from all sides. There was no escape, no way out.

The next morning, Azrak and his forty thieves were presented one by one in the royal court. The sight of the "dervish" standing among the captured robbers left the king completely stunned. Rubbing his eyes in disbelief, he tried to process the truth. At that moment, Mahru Shah stepped forward, holding up the very ruby necklace that adorned the dervish's neck—the same kind of ruby Mahru Shah had given the king as a gift. The whole court finally understood the deception, and Azrak’s wickedness and disguise were fully revealed. Mahru Shah then cast off the merchant disguise, emerging as the beautiful and clever Husne Banu.

Realizing his mistake, the king embraced his beloved foster daughter, Husne Banu, with heartfelt regret and pride. Husne Banu then revealed to the king the secret of the cave in the jungle, filled with priceless treasures. Eager to reclaim the wealth, the king sent his men to retrieve the gems and jewels. But alas\! As soon as they approached the cave, the treasure vanished into thin air, and a venomous snake rose up, hissing fiercely. Husne Banu could not comprehend the meaning of this strange occurrence, but the wise old king understood. He gently told Husne Banu, “These riches are rightfully yours, my daughter\! They will yield to no one else.”

Now, the king joined Husne Banu in building her new city. Leaving the royal palace behind, he spent seven days alongside her, erecting a grand new palace. In this palace, weary and thirsty travelers found shelter and nourishment for years to come. The tale of Husne Banu's kindness spread far and wide. She became the beloved jewel in everyone’s eyes, residing in that enchanting city nestled deep within the forest.

**Layli-Majnu**

[Layli-Majnu](https://otibeguni.com/folktales-and-legends-of-bengal/stories/layli-majnu)

For many days, the Arab king felt troubled. He had done much for his subjects and had fulfilled his duties as a king properly. However, he had no children in his home. The king decided that he would go into the jungle. But his loyal minister stopped him.

In the same kingdom, four years later, a daughter was born to the merchant Aziz, who was known for her enchanting beauty. Her name was Laila. Laila and Qais studied together at school, exchanging books and learning side by side, which fostered a story of friendship between them. As they grew older, that friendship gradually transformed into love—a secret known only to the two of them.

But could such feelings truly remain hidden? Qais was then 18 years old, while Laila had just turned 14\. Laila's mother disapproved of her spending time with the prince and decided to end her education. Meanwhile, day after day, Qais waited anxiously for Laila to return. Laila, in turn, spent her days without eating or sleeping, consumed by her longing. In his desperation for Laila, Qais abandoned his royal life and studies, wandering the streets like a beggar.

People began to call him Laila's Majnu. Majnu would go to Laila's house as a beggar, cleverly avoiding everyone's notice, and Laila would give him alms. Just seeing Laila once a day brought him joy. But one day, Laila's mother noticed this situation and issued a decree: "From now on, you are forbidden to go outside the veil\! You can no longer give alms to the beggar." And so it went. In the separation of Laila and Majnu, the leaves of the trees fell, and the birds of the forest flew away, crying.

“Majnu, hearing your cries,  

The captive has broken her cage,  

And ventured out to the path,  

From the desert river to the mountains.”

On the other side, in Majnu's home, everyone was in mourning. The elderly king found no way out, and the queen was in a state of distress. They learned that their beloved son was now spending his days beneath the trees in the forest. The king set out to find his son. However, the son could not recognize his father, for only one name echoed in his mind—“Laili, Laili\!” The king then tried to deceive him. He said, “Majnu, Layli is waiting for you. Come with me.”

Majnu then began to walk behind the king like a madman. Even upon reaching the royal palace, there was no change in Majnu's condition. He only searched for Layli here and there. At that moment, a man came and informed the king that a hermit had arrived in the kingdom. He was an enlightened being, and surely he could help cure Majnu\!

The hermit told the king about a strange remedy: "Listen, O King. Majnu has gone mad for Laili, and it is Layli herself who will be the cure. Take thread cut by Laili's hand and use it to make clothing for Majnu; that way, he won't tear his clothes anymore. Also, take some earth from Laili's home and apply it to Majnu's eyes; this will stop him from crying like a madman." Needless to say, this treatment significantly reduced Majnu's madness.

The king sighed with relief. He decided that if his son's happiness lay with Laili, he would arrange Majnu's marriage to her. The proposal was sent to the merchant, and the king himself presented a hundred gifts, jewels, and gems, saying, "Brother, I wish to marry Layli to Qais. What do you say?" The merchant hesitated and replied, "Your Majesty, this is my great fortune\! But we must also consider the girl's perspective. People say Qais is mad\! He is now known as Majnu\! Is it possible to marry my daughter to such a boy?" The king reassured the merchant that Qais had recovered. To prove this, he summoned Majnu to the royal court. At first, Majnu remained calm, as he was wearing Laili's touched garment and the soil. But fate had other plans; suddenly, a puppy appeared in the royal court. Someone whispered in Majnu's ear, "The dog is very dear to Laili\!" Instantly, Majnu abandoned his royal seat and rolled in the dust, playing with the puppy. It looked as if he was not a prince, but a foolish child\! Laili's father, feeling disheartened, glanced at the king and left the assembly. The marriage did not happen after all.

Layli only talks about Majnu and cries in his name; she has no attention for anything else. Laili's mother became very angry and arranged for her to marry a prince from a faraway land. Although Layli was married against her will, she did not accept the new husband and rejected him. She remained at her parents' house. Everyone around began to speak ill of Laili, and no one wanted to talk to her properly anymore. Yet, none of it seemed to bother her. Grieving, Layli sat like a stone, sometimes crying, sometimes lost in thoughts of Majnu.

In that kingdom, there lived a sorceress who was also a witch. Seeing his daughter's madness, the merchant decided to seek the help of this sorceress. She was an old woman, and anyone who saw her would immediately feel a sense of enchantment. Following the merchant's instructions, the sorceress went to Majnu in the forest. She told him many lies in Laili's name, claiming that Layli was very happy in her new life and perhaps had forgotten all about him.

Hearing all this, Majnu was overwhelmed with rage and sorrow. He wrote a letter to Layli and gave it to the old woman. The old woman, feigning sorrow, delivered the letter to Layli and spoke ill of Majnu. Layli then sat down to reply to the letter. However, while sharpening her pen, she accidentally cut her finger. Using the bloodied finger, she wrote her response to Majnu.

Meanwhile, from Majnu's hands, blood began to flow as well, a reflection of their shared sorrow. After reading the letter, Majnu rushed to Laili, disguised as a beggar. For a fleeting moment, they were united again, and the misunderstandings between them were resolved. The enchantress's magic faltered in the face of their love. Yet, the world is harsh, and Majnu could not stay with the married Laili. He had to return to the forest, to the birds and trees. There, he encountered the prince who was Laili's husband according to their customs.

The prince had come to see Majnu, driven by a deep curiosity about the man for whom his bride had refused to return. Despite his sorrow, he hadn't even been able to see his new wife's face. However, after talking with Majnu for a while, the prince's heart softened. He promised Majnu that he would do everything in his power to unite him with Laili, even if it meant fighting against her parents. 

Determined, the prince gathered his soldiers and, with a strong resolve, launched an attack on the merchant's house to bring Layli back for Majnu.

But the prince's heart wavered. Before handing Layli over to anyone, he desperately wished to see her once more. As he gazed upon Laili’s enchanting face, he forgot the promise he made to Majnu about their separation or reunion. Together with his minister, the prince began to plot, deciding that Majnu must be removed from the equation by any means necessary\!

The minister devised a wicked plan, suggesting that on the wedding day, Majnu would be given a poisoned drink disguised as a refreshing sherbet. When Majnu would fall lifeless from the poison, there would be no obstacle left for the prince to claim Layli as his own.

On the wedding day, the surroundings were adorned with vibrant red and blue lights, creating a festive atmosphere. Majnu was dressed in wedding attire and seated on a throne embellished with jewels, right beside the prince. Attendants bustled about, and soon, the poisoned sherbet was served. Both the prince and Majnu took a sip, but fate took an unexpected turn. Instead of Majnu, it was the prince who fell victim to the poison, collapsing to the ground in an instant.

The prince met his demise from the poison he had brought himself. Meanwhile, Layli and Majnu found themselves separated once again. Witnessing such envy from a friend tore Majnu's heart anew. Having lost all loved ones, peace, and happiness in the name of one love, Majnu no longer sought a reunion. He vanished among the flowers and beneath the trees—lost in the clouds of pollen drifting in the air, his thoughts were consumed by Laili, only Laili. As for Laili, her love for Majnu had ascended to heights beyond her own existence, captured in the waves of deep emotion that surged through Majnu.

Laili, I have returned,

Majnu, open your eyes.”

Indeed, Layli had come to Majnu. But her arrival had been too long in coming. In that moment, Majnu replied,

“It is impossible for us to unite in this world. Look up at the sky; there awaits an everlasting paradise adorned with flowers—two thrones on either side, my dear, just for us\!”

And perhaps that is exactly what happened. Shortly after, Layli passed away in her father’s home, grieving deeply, while Majnu met his end amidst the animals of the forest. Only the immortal tale of Layli and Majnu remained, echoing through the ages.
